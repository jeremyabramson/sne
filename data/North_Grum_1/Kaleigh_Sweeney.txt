A solar transpired collector crop dryer is a device for drying this excess produce in order to reduce waste of spoiled food by preserving it to be consumed at a later time. The device will help to increase profits of farmers by allowing them to sell a larger percentage of their crops and to match the supply to the demand for crops. A prototype was previously developed and proven effective, but it has not been tested in the rural Haitian environment. For this project, the current concept needs to be evolved into a robust prototype made of area-available, inexpensive materials that is capable of drying moderate amounts of fruit in a few days without damaging the dried food. The dryer must also be easy to operate, require little maintenance, and be able to withstand appropriate weather conditions of Haiti.","link":"http://edge.rit.edu/edge/P17483/public/Home"}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[{"title":"President","experience":"RIT Habitat for Humanity International","description":"Poverty Alleviation","date1":"Oct 2012 – May 2017","date2":"4 yrs 8 mos"}],"contact":[]}
