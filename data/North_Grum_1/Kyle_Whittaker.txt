He had been there for several years prior to my entry, and acted as a mentor to me during my earlier months.  Though to claim his ability to teach me something ended at that time would be remarkably disingenuous.\r\n\r\nBy the end of his tenure at Solipsys (before moving on to become Chief Scientist at Focused Support), we worked jointly to direct the technical aspects of all internal engineering and development activities at Solipsys (including all Product Development and all R&D).\r\n\r\nThere is one thing I can confidently say about Bryan, and I cannot stress this enough; there is no role he cannot fill.  He is unequivocally one of the most intelligent and adaptive individuals I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  His mathematical and technical skills are unmatched, and I have personally witnessed him learn and master new technologies in breathless time.  And to top it off, he excels at leadership of large groups and mentoring of new engineers.\r\n\r\nThere is no one I would rather work with on a technical effort to guarantee its fidelity and success.\n\n...
