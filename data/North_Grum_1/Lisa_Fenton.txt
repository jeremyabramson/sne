She manages her team with empathy and sensitivity to work/life balance issues while still ensuring that all the team’s goals are met. In addition, she is excellent at “extinguishing fires” (resolving a crisis) and she works extremely well under pressure, able to multitask and do whatever it takes to meet a customer’s deadline. I have seen her skillfully manage an extremely high workload by equally distributing the workload between the team and not hesitating to do the work herself and/or take other measures to ensure that her team was not too overworked. In addition, she does not push back on global time zone demands, such as having weekly conference calls with customers all over the world during the hours of the night. She is one of the hardest working managers that I have worked for.
