She can successfully communicate to people either in a one on one situation or with a large audience. This ability allows her, not only to have a high performing organization; but, also to be a team leader in cross functional situations.

One of the teams she led for automation had participants from the US, Latin America, Europe and Asia with great accomplishments.\nAs a manager, Martha provides her direct reports with goals and objectives that are in line with the end-to-end business strategy. She works with her subordinates as a team and at an individual level, clearing hurdles so that her team provides outstanding results. She creates an environment for her team so that people want to be successful.
