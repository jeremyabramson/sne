My work with Michael began in 2008, when we met as colleagues in the fight for cybersecurity awareness, education and preparedness. Michael led a small, yet strong, diligent team at NCSA, while I was engaged in similar efforts at the Securing our eCity Foundation. Michael’s charisma, kindness, empathy, intelligence and wisdom combine to make him one of the strongest leaders I know. In my 10 years working with him and his teams, I watched him transform NCSA from a small advocacy agency into a multi-tiered, multi program entity driving cyber awareness at the Federal level – developing and distributing campaigns that had far reaching impacts – one such campaign – “Stop|Think|Connect” went on to have tremendous impact, reach and visibility. This outcome was a direct result of Michael setting and executing a grand vision through his dedicated team.\nHis poise and stage presence at large industry events and his extensive knowledge of the cybersecurity landscape is second to none. Michael’s domain knowledge in areas of cybersecurity, privacy advocacy and non-profit operations are at the highest levels amongst the company I keep and he is extensively talented at articulating his expertise appropriately to any audience, whether that be a conference hall with 100’s/1000’s of industry experts or a smaller classroom of 20-40 students. Michael is an expert at engaging at every level and in every scenario.\nIf you are looking for a sharp, highly talented leader with a rich and full leadership toolset, Michael is your guy. Not only do I recommend him so highly for his skills and his ability to lead and execute, but I also know him to be a great man and a model citizen. This is the gentlemen you want at the helm navigating and growing your entity, whether it is a “for profit” business or a high impact “non-profit”.

From my experience, I have seen Chad as being one of the most respected participants in that collective community process. ESET as one of the nation’s leading cybersecurity companies brought obvious expertise to those efforts. But more importantly, Chad combined that deep knowledge of cybersecurity with an understanding of the importance of partnerships and how to make them work.\n\nESET had a Board Seat at the National Cyber Security Alliance, where I served as Executive Director. Chad was a strong supporter of our mission and was always accessible and open to listening to new ideas.  As an Executive Director it is always important to have partners that believe in your mission and are willing to support it. Chad could always be counted on to help us meet our goals by supporting research efforts, aligning local communications efforts with our national efforts to help people be safer and more secure online, and making ESET thought leaders available across a broad range of education and awareness activities.\n\nI hold Chad in the highest esteem as a leader and a partner.\n \n\n\n...

These efforts required not only working with me and the NCSA staff but representing and collaborating with key NCSA partners in industry and government.\n\nIn every effort, Jessica exceeded expectations. NCSA garnered more and higher quality media attention under Jessica's leadership then at any time in our history and broadened our coverage into many different verticals, a goal we had set for ourselves for many years but had yet to achieve. She delivered comprehensive and thoughtful media and communications plans that were built collaboratively with our partners and delivered key results on every plan.\n\nNCSA was demanding client. We had high bars for the quality of the content we shared, the media outlets we spoke to and growing year-over-year results. Jessica exceeded on every metric every time.  She exhibited great flexibility and poise working with the highest level of government, including the White House and corporate executives and their teams.\n\nJessica's efforts on NCSA's behalf were recognized as industry leading efforts as demonstrated by winning two Silver Anvil Awards from the Public Service Association of America for her work at NCSA. \n\n\n\n...
