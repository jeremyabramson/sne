She most recently took control of a very large $2.6B IT opportunity that had been in motion for over a year, rapidly brought focus and organization to the capture and proposal activities, solidified the team composition, and masterfully shepherded the proposal through multiple corporate review and approval cycles. She obviously did everthing right, because she/we recently won that job! The same week that win was announced, she also chalked up another win for an even larger recompete in our health IT business for which she was capture lead. Beverly is on a roll, and the accolades she is getting are well deserved. I highly recommend her.
