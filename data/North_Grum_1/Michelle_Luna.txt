As Ms. Luna’s former fellow Engineer Professional co-worker I found her to be a conscientious and hard worker. Ms. Luna brought to us her strong experience in Aviation Maintenance Data Management. Her background as a Navy Aviation Maintenance Logs/Records Supervisor and her Bachelor’s degree in Aviation Business Administration has proven her to be a valuable asset in the Systems Reliability Engineering field for unmanned systems.\n\nFurthermore, Ms. Luna’s work on unmanned systems as a reliability engineering data analyst demonstrates careful attention to detail. She is able to articulate her data analysis to find and correct errors that may skew the results and aims for accurate reporting. In fact, because of Ms. Luna’s perseverance her data analysis has made it into the operational performance reports that not only went to the company’s senior management but to also US congressional members as well.\n\nMs. Luna is an extremely personable young woman who seems equally comfortable with her peers and with DoD customers and has excellent inter-personal skills. She has talked to me about her future goals to include Business Management and/or in an Engineering environment in an aviation industry and I have enjoyed seeing such enthusiasm in her about her future professional career.
