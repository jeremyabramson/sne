I had the distinct pleasure of working with her for approximately six years as a software engineer for Northrop Grumman. During this time, Mimi led several projects for a number of our key customers. Her knowledge, professionalism, and attention to detail made her the best candidate to lead these projects. Mimi’s performance was often impeccable and frequently exceeded expectations. She often received kudos and recognition from the customers. Due to her direct efforts, we were able to achieve an increase in our Customer Performance Assessment Rating (CPAR) during her tenure. She was recognized for her efforts via Northrop Grumman's Timely Award Program (TAP). This program recognized and rewarded successful engineers that went above and beyond and made significant contributions to the organization's performance. Mimi was also selected to participate in Northrop Grumman’s Mentoring the Technical Professional (MTP) Program. This program groomed junior engineers to become leaders in their desired technical areas of interest. As a program alumni, she still participates in the program and is active in recruiting junior engineers into the program. I really enjoyed working with Mimi and was able to see first-hand what she was able to achieve. I would recommend her for any engineering team lead, project management, or engineering management position. She is highly skilled and capable, dedicated and professional, and would be a valued asset to any team.\nSee less","profileImage":"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQEkVh4yJ-ROGQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0/1591787094902?e=1619654400&v=beta&t=SXco9FTlM-c_0idervLNzAkHobdfG2PjB1m5nBhR-J0","name":"Brian Parsons","userDescription":"Cyber Systems Engineering Manager at Northrop Grumman"}]},"accomplishments":[{"count":"10","title":"Honors & Awards","items":["BRAVO!
