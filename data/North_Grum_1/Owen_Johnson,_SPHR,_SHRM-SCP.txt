When I reached out to Owen telling her I thought I had a candidate she was really appreciative but not only that she was extremely knowledgeable about the role the Systems Engineer played within Revionics. She asked all the right technical questions which showed me she went above and beyond what the typical Acquisition Manager does. She truly understands the positions/roles that she's recruiting. On top of just being great at her job, she's one of the nicest people I've met. I would recommend Owen without hesitation.
