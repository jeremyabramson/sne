She is a significant contributor to the department and is a competent and dedicated employee. She is cooperative and willing to do other assignments beyond expectations.  She is key in assisting with developing policies and procedures. She oversees a large volume of procedures that require her to review, make recommended changes and track them through the Quality Management Peer Review team.  This is a tedious task that requires attention to detail and the ability to interact with various individuals.  Her computer skills are top quality and she is the point of contact for the entire department for assistance and ensuring the team has the required computer and IT equipment. She grasps new ideas and instructions quickly and takes the initiative to serve and support the department.  She can always be counted on to follow through and ensure tasks are tracked and completed.  Janine has strong customer service skills and she works well with all levels of individuals including Corporate staff. She is resourceful and a reliable asset to the team as well as internal customers.  Janine can always be relied upon for support. It has been my pleasure to work with her and I recommend her.\n\n...
