From the moment I stepped foot at SpaceX,  he showed me the ropes on how to be successful. Kevin really took the initiative to a new individual like myself and walked me through the complexity that is SpaceX recruiting.  He showed great communication skills and leadership every time I had a question and never hesitated to assure me that I was doing a good job. Not only is Kevin a great teacher, he is someone who leads from the front. He shows how to be a great recruiter by doing the work himself. Kevin has broken records in hires he has had in a year while his short time here at SpaceX. He builds relationships with his hiring teams and goes all out to provide the best customer service to them. What makes Kevin a great recruiter and co-worker is that he puts others before him and always has their best interest in mind. Kevin would excel no matter where he worked, but I am glad that we can call him family here at SpaceX. \n\n...
