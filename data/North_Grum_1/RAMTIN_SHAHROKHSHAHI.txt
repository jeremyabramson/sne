Two Solar panels and a wind turbine generate maximum of 38 Watts of power. Voltage regulators, rectifiers, inverts and differential amplifiers are used to transmit power. buck and boost converters adjust voltage for consumption. Grid is equipped with power managements and SCADA for circuitry supervision. Two batteries are used as secondary power source and can be charge through renewal energy and discharge through load. Batteries discharge when power generation drops lower than consumption through automated power management system.","link":"https://youtu.be/bGrbNloZ618"}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
