He regularly showed initiative, drive, acquisition knowledge, and the ability to align to a strategy from upper management. His direction as one of the Government leads in the D5 Life Extension Program led to his avionic subsystem being a part of the first LE hardware flight. This was a major milestone for the program as a whole and his leadership and big picture focus constantly drove the team through technical reviews (CDR, PRR, PCA, FRR) and eventually being ready for flight. Daryl's understanding of strategic management also was a benefit to my branch as he took on a SWOT/Strategic Plan initiative that focused on making the organization efficient and aligned for the future. He completed the SWOT analysis, developed outcomes, created the framework for a tiger team to address the implementation, and built an initial team to work the next steps. The data from the SWOT analysis across the branch is still being used today in self assessments and way to improve the branch.\n\n...
