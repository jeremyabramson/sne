I've enjoyed keeping up with him as our careers have diverged, and can't wait to see where he ends up next.\n\nEvan brings his own can-do attitude to a team, but he particularly excels at bringing out the same attitude in everyone around him. He is always up for taking on a challenge -- whether or not it has any relation to his job description -- and is always willing to go above and beyond to see his team succeed.\n\nWherever his path takes him next, I would wholeheartedly endorse Evan's analytical skills and breadth of knowledge, his emotional intelligence, and foremost his ethic of servant leadership that prioritizes the success of his team above all.  He is an asset to any team.\n\n...
