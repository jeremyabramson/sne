In addition to developing elegant and intuitive user interfaces, he conducts user research with rigor, consistently challenges our personal and institutional bias (in a good way), and quickly cuts to the heart of user issues and pain points. As a project manager, I really appreciate Steven’s proactivity and his willingness to seek out and apply innovative approaches to challenges. Steven got me hooked on the GV problem framing and design sprint methodology after he researched and pitched it to leadership. We’ve applied this approach, with great success, to a number of projects and we have him to thank for seeking it out and communicating its value. While I could continue on about Steven’s many positive attributes, I’ll conclude by saying that Steven is a great team player who is articulate, perceptive, and detail-oriented and is a great asset to any product team. \n\n...
