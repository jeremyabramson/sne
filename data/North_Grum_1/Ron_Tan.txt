My wife and I were very picky when it came to house shopping and Kin must have showed us over a hundred properties over almost a year span. Kin's best qualities are his in depth knowledge of the entire real-estate business and his keen ability to assess property attributes that can add or detract from a property's value. It was a privilege to work with him as he was able to find us a great home that we love. I look forward to finding the next house with Kin!\n\nThanks Kin!
