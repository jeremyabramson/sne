Whenever I had questions for the human resource department, I always went to Shannell because of her friendly personality and ability to answer the questions thoroughly. I noted that she was dedicated to doing her job well and was very genuine in the way she interacted with coworkers. She checked up on me often to see how I enjoyed my work, and about life in general. She is definitely an asset to ATK.

Our family adopted two girls (sisters) from Rio. Camilla was instrumental in making this adoption happen and go smoothly.  She was open and honest with us about the entire adoption process, the fees, the regulations, as well as the orphanage we would be working with and the girls that we now call our daughters.  She was knowledgeable about all the laws, regulations, and requirements on both the Brazilian side and the US side.  She was always available to take phone calls and provide advice.  She is action oriented and kept things moving forward.  When we traveled to Brazil, she personally met us at the airport when we arrived, she helped with our transportation to our apartment, she went to lunch with us and talked with us about the culture and she walked us around the area where we were going to be staying to help us understand the best places to shop, eat, and go for entertainment.  She goes above and beyond 100% of the time.  Camilla has a commitment and desire to help the children in Brazil to get in better situations and she puts her whole heart into her work.  If you are thinking about adoption from Brazil don't look anywhere else, but to hand-in-hand working with Camilla. \n\n...

Jeff is very positive and he is always a delight to work with.  He thinks ahead to anticipated potential problems and is constantly asking questions, doing research, and trying new approaches in order to get the best product possible. Jeff thinks outside the box and never says \"it's impossible!\"  Jeff is willing to give and take constructive feedback to improve processes and products.   Jeff consistently delivered above and beyond my expectations.  He is very personable, and has always demonstrated nothing other than the highest level of professionalism and ethical behavior. Jeff can be depended on to complete tasks in a timely fashion when assigned to him. I would definitely recommend Jeff Shepherd for any position that he should apply for. I hope our paths cross again someday.\n\n...
