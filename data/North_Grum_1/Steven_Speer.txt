The chosen solution –\no Since had the source code, reprogrammed FAST to run on Unix/Linux/Windows using\nOpenGL instead of IrisGL, and new libraries were created to replace missing low level\noperating system/windowing level graphical user interface (GUI) functionality.\no The benefit – provided NGAS the ability to support all CFD projects using both existing\nand new computers without substantial increase in cost, i.e. saved the company money\no Was recognized for my significant achievement with a $10K stock incentive award from\nupper management.\nThe main NGAS CFD code requires occasional new algorithms and boundary conditions (BC’s) to\nsupport new program analysis requirements and improved overall code performance\no In 2010 – added new periodic BC, variable discharge coefficient bleed mass flow BC, and\nFull Navier Stokes mode to provide alternate to the Thin Layer simplifications. The\nbenefits were different CFD group members were given new capabilities they needed.\no In 2008 – to remedy the poor solution convergence problem being encountered on\nsome projects which required CFD simulations in near stagnant or extremely low Mach\nnumber flows – researched the Low Mach Number Pre-conditioning scheme\nsee less","date1":"Jan 2006 – Jan 2011","date2":"5 yrs 1 mo"},{"title":"Aeronautical Engineer","description":"implemented in NASA Overflow code. Verified/re-derived the equations to be\ncompatible with GCNS’s algorithms. Coded the new scheme. The benefit was reduced\nsimulation time and less iteration to arrive at a converged solution.; Faced with the main NGAS CFD code GNCS only running on Unix, using older parallel processing\ntechnologies, and having little documentation – I was tasked with first learning the code and\nsetting to work to fix the identified problems:\no In 2005 – Converted GCNS to run on Linux and use MPI libraries, replacing the legacy\nPVM library usage. Allowed the code to run again on distributed memory machines.\no In 2004 – Converted GCNS to use OpenMP compiler directive loop parallelization,\nreplacing the various legacy non standard equivalents. Allowed the code to run\nfaster on shared memory clusters and multi-processor Unix/Windows computers.\no In 2003 – Studied and learned the GCNS code. Began to assemble documentation.\nCreated first GCNS version to run on the Window Operating system. Benefit opened\nup new analysis opportunities for the CFD group and proved I had acquired enough\nunder of the source code to successfully modified it and move in new directions.\nsee less","date1":"Jan 2003 – Jan 2006","date2":"3 yrs 1 mo"}]}],"educations":[{"title":"Florida Institute of Technology","degree":"MS","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/18092/?legacySchoolId=18092","fieldOfStudy":"Software Engineering","date1":"2012","date2":"2015"},{"title":"University of California, Los Angeles","degree":"PhD","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/17950/?legacySchoolId=17950","fieldOfStudy":"Fluid Mechanics","date1":"2001","date2":"2005","description":"All but dissertation"},{"title":"University of California, Los Angeles","degree":"MS","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/17950/?legacySchoolId=17950","fieldOfStudy":"Aerospace Engineering","date1":"1999","date2":"2001"}],"skills":[{"title":"Aerospace","count":"3"},{"title":"CFD","count":"2"},{"title":"Systems Engineering","count":"1"},{"title":"Aerospace Engineering"}],"recommendations":{"givenCount":"0","receivedCount":"0","given":[{}],"received":[]},"accomplishments":[],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
