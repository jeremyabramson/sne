Aside from being an absolute joy to have at our company, her enthusiasm and positive \"can-do\" attitude helped us charter unfamiliar territory as we were getting ready to publicly announce our service and make our nacent voice be heard in the very noisy wedding space. Jennifer not only rose to the challenge of executing on a complex social media marketing campaign but also contributed her own thoughts and creativity to our efforts to ensure success, and she did all this while managing an extremely demanding semester at ASU full of coursework and activities. Her dedication and hard work was truly admirable -- we simply could not have done it without her and were very grateful to have her on our team.  She is an exceptionally bright and talented woman who I am excited to see blossom in her career. I would highly recommend Jennifer's work at WedDone and would absolutely love the chance to work with her again.\n\n...

As her colleague, I was able to observe firsthand how Han contributed greatly to the success of the project. Therefore, I would highly recommend her for business management positions that require strong skills in strategic critical thinking, creativity in problem solving, natural leadership, and professionalism especially under stressful situations. On this project, she demonstrated that she: \r\n\r\n1.\tExcels at deriving structure from ambiguity to solve problems with strategic critical thinking. She is very thoughtful about complex business problems and processes data quickly and able to hone in on key insights; she is also quite talented at crafting story-lines meaningful to intended audiences and presenting information in a logical and structured way. She is very creative and constantly thinking about new approaches to tackle issues in the most effective manner.\r\n2.\tNot only a great team member but also naturally gravitates toward a leadership role.  On our team, she became go-to-person for team members and the client for all the financial aspects of the due diligence procedures, as she possessed both a firm grasp of both the details of financial model as well as a big picture view of all aspects of the operations of the target company as a whole. Therefore, she was able to communicate not only the current state of the project but also what next steps were required to drive the project to completion.\r\n3.\tRetains poise under in stressful situations and thrives in challenging and fast paced environments. She can stay calm under pressure and tense situations, which enables her to lead meetings with senior level executives. Her ability to skillfully spur meaningful discussions to resolve business issues was especially invaluable considering the challenging communications issues in our work environment.\n\n...
