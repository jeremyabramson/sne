build a robotic skunk to study the predatory\nresponse to prey with defensive behavior and coloration.\nThe robotic model will aid the investigation of the predator’s ability to avoid negative\ninteractions when faced with prey possessing defensive capabilities. The model of the platform will be exposed to wild coyotes and domestic dogs.\nThe overall design must be safe for the subjects to interact with and durable to withstand any possible attacks that may be inflicted by the predator. I designed the Chassis through sheet metal forming in Solidworks and performed a stress analysis to simulate a dog bite and gained experience through manufacturing it by cutting, bending, milling and welding it with various equipment.","link":"https://csulbmaefall2013groupf.wordpress.com/"}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
