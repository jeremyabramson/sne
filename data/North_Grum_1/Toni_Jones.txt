She put in many long hours in order to meet the demand of her workload. I have found that working with Dominique is a collaborative effort. She has been able to work with a variety of different personalities and has a way of bringing out the best in them. She has always been willing to look to her team for support, is flexible to change directions if it is needed to meet the goals of the project and is willing to go that extra mile.  \r\n\r\nAfter knowing and working with Dominique, I have learned that her driving force is knowledge. She never ceases to ask the right questions. With each project thereâ€™s an opportunity to learn something new, to define ways to visually communicate to audiences in order to connect with them.  \r\n\r\nThe challenges that professionals in the creative services industry are constantly faced with, like high demand with shorter and shorter turnaround times, makes  Dominique work even harder. She doesnâ€™t lower her expectations due to a lack of resources, her standards remain high and her plan stays flexible enough to be able to succeed the requirements of the job. At the end of the day, she wants to know that she has pulled her team together to meet and exceed an expectation. \r\n\r\nThese are the qualities that make a great leader. Great leadership is the epitome of an excellent creative manager.\n\n...
