Three words describe Walt: Reliable, Adaptable, and Collaborative.\n\nReliable: Walt is one of those fairly rare individuals who simply get their assignments done on time (or early) with unfailingly high quality, every time. The quality and value of Walt’s work is recognized across our sector and to other sectors in our company. I have zero concern when Walt has taken on a task no matter how critical or visible.\nAdaptable: We have undergone two reorganizations in the past two years, with numerous other adjustments to our team’s responsibilities. Walt has accepted every new development with his calm, unflappable manner, and pressed on. Whenever I hand him a task in an area new to him (a common occurrence), he rapidly learns what was required to complete it. He is deeply engaged in our Agile process, serving as Scrum Master.\nCollaborative: Walt is outstanding in effectively working with diverse teams across the organization, including Engineering, HR, Organizational Effectiveness, and Communications. He has become a valued member of the cross-sector team managing several formal technical talent development programs across the enterprise. He led the construction of a curriculum for training our 0-3 year engineers, which has been adopted by other parts of Northrop Grumman.
