It has been my job to ensure that my company and its leadership look good before our customers, congress, and the general public, but more importantly that our messages reach their intended audiences with maximum impact and clarity.\n\nThough I am an accomplished artist in several mediums, I consider my ability to tell powerful stories to be one of my most beneficial capabilities. It is particularly critical in highly technical environments be able to connect complex solutions with stories that real people can relate to. I make it my business to use story to help decision makers understand why a solution will help meet their needs and why they should trust us. I love seeing the that turning point on a person's face when the 'get it'.\nsee less","date1":"1985 – Present","date2":"36 yrs"}],"educations":[{"title":"California State University-Long Beach","degree":"Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/17828/?legacySchoolId=17828","fieldOfStudy":"Art/Art Studies, General","date1":"1981","date2":"1985"}],"skills":[{"title":"Graphic Design","count":"21"},{"title":"Creative Direction","count":"19"},{"title":"Animation","count":"16"},{"title":"Video","count":"15"},{"title":"Layout","count":"13"},{"title":"Computer Animation","count":"12"},{"title":"Proposal Writing","count":"10"},{"title":"Storyboarding","count":"9"},{"title":"Multimedia","count":"7"},{"title":"Video Production","count":"6"},{"title":"Drawing","count":"6"},{"title":"Film","count":"5"},{"title":"Corporate Communications","count":"4"},{"title":"Motion Graphics","count":"4"},{"title":"Modeling","count":"4"},{"title":"Internal Communications","count":"3"},{"title":"3D","count":"3"},{"title":"3D Modeling","count":"3"},{"title":"Writing","count":"2"},{"title":"Brand Development","count":"1"},{"title":"Photoshop","count":"13"},{"title":"Adobe Creative Suite","count":"2"},{"title":"Public Speaking","count":"4"},{"title":"Storytelling","count":"4"},{"title":"Team Leadership","count":"2"},{"title":"Concept Design","count":"3"},{"title":"Executive Communications","count":"2"},{"title":"Corporate Storytelling","count":"2"},{"title":"3D animation","count":"1"},{"title":"Script writing","count":"1"},{"title":"Communication Training","count":"1"}],"recommendations":{"givenCount":"2","receivedCount":"4","given":[{"user":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-burke-191a0630/","text":"I highly recommend William: he is incredibly creative, with a fantastic capability to capture the essence of a message and transform it into superb imagery.

He is able to take complex and often very theoretical concepts and translate them into powerful, intuitive, high-impact graphics. He is, at heart, a storyteller, who is as comfortable with visual artists as he is with engineers and high-powered executives.

We have worked together on many efforts, large and small.   Without hesitation, I can say that every project that I have worked on with John is better than I could have achieved on my own.  John brings a wealth of knowledge and experience from the Film and Television industry as well as formal training to bear on the projects that he tackles.   Having John on your team as a creative story teller is a tremendous asset, but he is a start to finish professional artist that brings visual creativity together with seasoned hands on skills to realize his ideas at the highest quality levels.\r\n   John is very passionate about the craft and will not settle for anything less than exceptional and will give nothing less his best.  I cannot recommend him highly enough.\n\n...

Though it was not historically his field, Adam has been such a quick study that most think that he is 20 years steeped in the industry.  Well Hollywood's loss has been our gain.  \r\n   Adam brings fresh, thoughtful and business savvy ideas to what is typically a rigid, almost sterile business environment.  His talents range widely from script and speech writing to strategic business planning.  I have enjoyed worked closely with Adam on many creative communications efforts.  Over and over, he has proven himself to be a tremendous thinker on a broad range of topics as well as an excellent listener and skilled facilitator.  Adam has the uncommon ability to collaborate freely without the bothersome gamesmanship that often accompanies people as knowledgeable and well read as Adam is.  \r\n  If I were picking a team to tackle a difficult communications task, to brand an organization or to run it, I would, without hesitation, seek to have Adam at my side.  His inputs and creative energy elevate a team's overall performance, while his amiable personality and determined spirit help make otherwise thorny tasks enjoyable.\n\n...
