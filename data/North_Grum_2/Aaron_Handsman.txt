The program is conducted at the council level over a week or over two weekends. It is intended to provide standardized, in-depth training covering a number of leadership ideas and skills for Boy Scouts, Varsity Scouts and Venturers. This training is an element of the overall leadership training program.\"\n\n\"National Youth Leadership Training is an exciting, action-packed program designed for councils to provide youth members with leadership skills and experience they can use in their home troops and in other situations demanding leadership of self and others.\"\n\n\"The NYLT course centers around the concepts of what a leader must BE, what he must KNOW, and what he must DO. The key elements are then taught with a clear focus on HOW TO. The skills come alive during the week as the patrol goes on a Quest for the Meaning of Leadership.\"\nsee less","date1":"2007 – 2009","date2":"2 yrs"}],"educations":[{"title":"University of Michigan","degree":"Bachelor of Arts (BA)","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/18633/?legacySchoolId=18633","fieldOfStudy":"History"},{"title":"West Orange High School","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=West%20Orange%20High%20School"}],"skills":[{"title":"Leadership","count":"35"},{"title":"Public Speaking","count":"20"},{"title":"Training","count":"19"},{"title":"Recruiting","count":"16"},{"title":"Talent Acquisition","count":"12"},{"title":"Human Resources","count":"8"},{"title":"Community Outreach","count":"6"},{"title":"Resume Writing","count":"5"},{"title":"Technical Recruiting","count":"5"},{"title":"College Recruiting","count":"3"},{"title":"Student Affairs","count":"3"},{"title":"Consulting","count":"3"},{"title":"Social Media","count":"3"},{"title":"Microsoft Excel","count":"7"},{"title":"Applicant Tracking Systems","count":"5"},{"title":"Microsoft Office","count":"3"},{"title":"Microsoft PowerPoint","count":"3"},{"title":"Conflict Resolution","count":"8"},{"title":"Interviews","count":"7"},{"title":"Career Counseling","count":"4"},{"title":"Staff Development","count":"4"},{"title":"Leadership Development","count":"3"},{"title":"Organizational Development","count":"3"},{"title":"Interviewing","count":"3"},{"title":"House Blessings","count":"4"},{"title":"Workshop Facilitation","count":"3"}],"recommendations":{"givenCount":"0","receivedCount":"0","given":[{}],"received":[]},"accomplishments":[{"count":"1","title":"Honor & Award","items":["Eagle Scout"]},{"count":"1","title":"Language","items":["English"]}],"languages":[{"name":"English","proficiency":"Native or bilingual proficiency"}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[{"title":"Blood Donor","experience":"American Red Cross","description":"Health","date2":"Cause"}],"contact":[]}
