He gave us an informative safety talk that helped us learn how to do things properly on the job. The day was very organized and I always felt I had a task to do. Andrew pushed us to step out of our comfort zone and try new things. He helped me several times when I had questions. 40 women on a construction site sounds overwhelming, but he was calm and collected the whole time. I definitely recommend Andrew for a leadership role!
