He demonstrated the ability to generate and implement “out-of-the-box” solutions and employed his vast technical expertise to provide additional depth and fidelity to each client deliverable.  \r\n\r\nI had the opportunity to partner with Vimal on a large, complex project in support of a very reputable Tier 1 defense contractor. He excelled in supporting the project from end-to-end: developing the methodology for analysis, conducting the research, assessing the raw data, and presenting the resulting out brief.  According to the client’s Chief Engineer, it was “…the best analysis I have ever seen”.\r\n\r\nBeyond his technical and functional competencies, Vimal is also a consummate professional and team player – selfless with his time and always willing to offer his help and counsel when needed.  His demeanor and good nature made him a joy to work with.  I would recommend Vimal to anyone who wants what one might consider to be an anomaly: a brilliant engineer with strong consulting capabilities.\n\n...

She was able to accommodate our last minute request (we only gave ourselves three months to plan for it) and at a very reasonable price!  \r\n\r\nOn the wedding day, Sarah arrived an hour early and stayed a few hours late.  Our guests remarked how ambitious she was with our shots, and how she and her husband took every opportunity they had to capture the events of the evening.  I find myself very lucky to have found someone who was not only professional and accommodating, but displayed an extraordinary amount of talent as well.  \r\n\r\nMy words can go only so far...all it takes is just one look at her photos... \r\n\r\nThanks again Sarah!\n\n...
