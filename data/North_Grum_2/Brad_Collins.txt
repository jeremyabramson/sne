The primary technical interface with the customer, external reviewers, specialty engineering, and subcontractor manufacturing the unit.\n• Completed environmental testing to qualification levels and final design review 2 months ahead of schedule.\nsee less","date1":"Sep 2008 – Jan 2014","date2":"5 yrs 5 mos"},{"title":"Electrical Engineer","description":"Subsystem Engineer for Command & Data Handling (C&DH) Subsystem (SS) on Satellite Program\nPerformed and documented all analyses including critical timing and latencies, throughput, and bus loading. Documented critical item control plans, and limitations and constraints. Updated requirement linkages, allocations, and rationales in DOORS.\n\nUnit Verification Engineer on Multiple Satellite Programs\nCreated verification approach, schedule, and test plans for units and lower-level components. Developed predictor models and generated manufacturing test vectors. Collaborated with Test Engineers to write test procedures for manufacturing and environmental test.\n\nASIC Design Engineer on AEHF and NPOESS Programs\nPerformed ASIC design using VHDL and simulated design using Mentor Graphic's Questa. Synthesized designs using Synopsys Design Compiler. Performed cross-clock domain checks and formal verification using Cadence Conformal.\n• Both ASICs achieved first pass success\n\nFPGA Design & Verification Engineer on Multiple Satellite Programs\n• Architected a common on-chip bus design with Open-Core Protocol (OCP) interfaces.\n• Led a team of three engineers to add a reliable data delivery protocol to FPGA with Spacewire interfaces. Supported analysis of system performance using Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) as forward error correction (FEC) code for packets. Synthesized FPGA designs using Synplify Pro.\n• Designed FPGA that buffers data from multiple sources into priority queues, implemented in a single SDRAM, with dynamically allocated sizes. Formatted data into packets by priority and output to the downlink at 160 Mbps.\n• Implemented constrained-random testbench using SystemVerilog (SV) and Open Verification Methodology (OVM) to verify FPGAs. Used Property Specification Language (PSL) to write assertions and collect functional coverage metrics. First in organization to use Cadence Incisive Formal Verifier (IFV) tool to formally verify blocks within FPGA design.\nsee less","date1":"Jan 2001 – Aug 2008","date2":"7 yrs 8 mos"}]},{"title":"Electrical Engineer Assistant","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/annapolis-micro-systems/","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/annapolis-micro-systems/","companyName":"Annapolis Micro Systems","description":"Performed custom ASIC layout from gate-level schematics using Cadence Virtuoso.","date1":"May 2000 – Aug 2000","date2":"4 mos"},{"title":"Electrical Engineer Co-op","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/deptofdefense/","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/deptofdefense/","companyName":"United States Department of Defense","description":"Created C++ program to simulate laser range finding from an aircraft using digital terrain elevation and global positioning data.","date1":"Sep 1997 – Apr 2000","date2":"2 yrs 8 mos"}],"educations":[{"title":"University of Southern California","degree":"Masters of Science","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/17971/?legacySchoolId=17971","fieldOfStudy":"Electrical Engineering","date1":"2001","date2":"2003"},{"title":"George Mason University","degree":"Bachelor of Science","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/19576/?legacySchoolId=19576","fieldOfStudy":"Electrical Engineering","date1":"1995","date2":"2000"}],"skills":[{"title":"FPGA","count":"16"},{"title":"Systems Engineering","count":"13"},{"title":"VHDL","count":"11"},{"title":"Earned Value Management","count":"4"},{"title":"Electronics","count":"3"},{"title":"ASIC","count":"3"},{"title":"Electrical Engineering","count":"2"},{"title":"Aerospace","count":"2"},{"title":"Simulations","count":"2"},{"title":"C++","count":"3"},{"title":"Functional Verification","count":"9"},{"title":"Integrated Circuit Design","count":"4"},{"title":"SystemVerilog","count":"4"},{"title":"Cadence","count":"3"},{"title":"Space Systems","count":"1"}],"recommendations":{"givenCount":"0","receivedCount":"0","given":[{}],"received":[]},"accomplishments":[],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
