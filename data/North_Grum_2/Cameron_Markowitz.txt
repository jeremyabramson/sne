I strive to lead ahead of managing due to the dividends ‘paid’ in creating more leadership mentalities among individuals on a team. My positive attitude when the chips are down, builds comradery, strengthening bonds among teams, and ultimately stops issues from becoming irreversible.\n\nAfter Leaving the military in 2015 and graduating from the University of San Diego in 2018 I have been gaining momentum in my personal growth. In the military, I lived by the Rescue Swimmer motto “So Others May Live”, and I strive to continue to help others in any way I can. I have two concrete goals in life that I want to accomplish. One is to leave this world cleaner and greener than I found it, and two help others find self-sufficient leadership.\n\nLooking forward to meeting you, take care.\n\nCheers,\nCameron Markowitz"},"about":{"text":"I am a self-sufficient team playing problem solver that enjoys an altruistic lifestyle in leadership.
