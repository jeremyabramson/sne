Based on his skill set, scholastic achievement, and work ethic, I highly recommend Chad for a responsible position in a Mechanical Engineering capacity. To give a real life workplace example of his skills: During an especially tightly-compressed-schedule aircraft program design/build phase, I came to rely on Chad to help several of the subsystem and structures designers with a variety of Specs and Standards questions. Under rather general supervision, Chad made use of his growing knowledge of industry and company standards to provide solutions in a timely manner that were technically sound and accurate. He developed contacts at subsystems and fluid parts suppliers, obtaining vendor drawings and requesting clarification of details when necessary. His contributions were of immediate benefit and at times enabled designers to meet rigorous schedule milestones. Again, for these reasons, as well as his demonstrated skill working with the standard tool sets of Catia, NX, and Teamcenter (PLM), I offer this recommendation for Chad Victorino.
