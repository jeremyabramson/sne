I write margins, design and analyze composite laminates, perform fatigue analysis, develop material and design allowables, develop system level and detailed finite element models, develop test requirements, and support or supervise testing. I have the demonstrated capability to develop hardware from a clean sheet design and deliver a tested end product along with the necessary documentation.\n\nMy skillset extends beyond what is typically expected of a stress analyst; with extensive experience performing thermo-elastic distortion and surface contour analysis of antenna systems for the space environment; development of loads transformation matrices for vehicle level dynamic analyses; and topology optimization analysis for additive manufacturing. I am experienced in the methods of frequency and time domain dynamic analyses for both linear and nonlinear structures and mechanisms and have analyzed extremely dynamic events such as those generated by release devices.\n\nI am highly proficient with many FEM pre/post tools including Femap, Patran, Abaqus/CAE, and NX CAE. With a background in design, I am fluent with the major CAD software packages: Creo, CATIA, and NX. I use programming with Matlab and Excel VBA to create analysis tools,preprocess models, postprocess results, generate loads, etc."},"about":{"text":"I am an aerospace structural engineer offering 17 years of analysis, design, and test experience in composite and metallic spacecraft structures and payloads, military aircraft structures, and commercial aircraft.\n\nMy experience as a structural analyst has included static and dynamic analyses with large displacement and nonlinear constitutive material models, both with the use of finite element modeling as well as classical closed form solutions.
