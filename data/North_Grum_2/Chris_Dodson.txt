I also gained knowledge of aircraft structural design & subsystems, avionics, navigation systems and RF data links. I was the team lead for the Autopilot group of this project, providing me with valuable leadership skills for the future."}],"skills":[{"title":"Aerospace Engineering","count":"3"},{"title":"Flight Control Systems"},{"title":"Systems Engineering"},{"title":"Verification and Validation (V&V)"},{"title":"Scripting"},{"title":"Avionics","count":"1"},{"title":"ANSYS","count":"3"},{"title":"matlab"},{"title":"Simulink"},{"title":"CATIA","count":"1"},{"title":"Rational DOORS"},{"title":"MKS Integrity"}],"recommendations":{"givenCount":"0","receivedCount":"0","given":[{}],"received":[]},"accomplishments":[{"count":"1","title":"Project","items":["Boeing AeorsPACE"]}],"projects":[{"name":"Boeing AeorsPACE","date":"Aug 2013 – May 2014","description":"Aerospace Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering (AerosPACE) was a Boeing sponsored, multi-disciplinary, multi-university, design, build, and fly project. As part of a 12 member team, technical areas were addressed to satisfy the requirements of flying a blended wing body style unmanned aerial vehicle capable of mapping agriculture fields. The areas of this project in which I focused include aerodynamics, stability and control, development/integration of the autopilot system, and the manufacturing process. AVL was used to analyze reflex airfoils during the airfoil selection process. AVL was also used to obtain stability derivatives, which were combined with mass properties into a linearized state space model using Matlab, providing the stability and control characteristics. Mission Planner was used to program the Ardupilot 2.6 autopilot system as it provided a multiplatform configuration and full-featured waypoint mission scripting as a basis for the ground control station. I was responsible for fabricating, modifying, installing, troubleshooting, repairing, and maintaining ground, airborne and electronic equipment for the UAV and ground control station. I also took part in the carbon fiber layup of the skins, as well as repairing and maintaining components of the UAV. In parallel with meeting the requirements this project introduced ways of collaborating with teammates across different time zones through online communication and collaborative tools."}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
