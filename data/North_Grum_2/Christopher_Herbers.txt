Right out of college Walter exemplified true professionalism and incredible leadership skills.

He quickly became a subject matter expert on my team and mentored Subcontract Administrators of all ages and skill levels.\n\nWalter works equally well within his own organization and on cross-functional teams. Walter is a great asset to any team and can rapidly research complex problems and provide innovative solutions. More importantly, while Walter will attack problems with great tenacity, he remains a very sincere and caring person. During his time in my organization Walter was formally recognized (Star Program) by his peers and customers for his support/accomplishments on a regular basis (far exceeding that of any other employee).\n\nWalter is incredibly smart and takes time to research and understand with great depth whatever effort he is working. His international experience and foreign language skills (3 languages) are unique and valuable for any business working outside of the US Domestic market.\n\nHe goes above and beyond all expectations and is always willing to help a team member. He was very quickly identified as a high potential management candidate by myself and the NGC leadership.\n\nI hold Walter in exceptionally high regard and know very few people who are as enthusiastic and passionate about their work as he.
