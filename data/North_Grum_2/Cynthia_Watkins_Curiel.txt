When I hired her as the first employee on my growing team, she joined an industry in which she had no experience -- aerospace and defense -- and commanded respect in a newly created position she made entirely her own. She intrinsically understands the balance between paid and earned media. She can clearly articulate how research well done will shape a winning strategy to successfully achieve a series of clear objectives. She has the vision to drive public relations strategy to connect relevant, cardinal 'dots' into a compelling story for a brand, a special event, or individual projects large and small. Heather is a natural leader. At the heart of her strong professional performance is the confident way she builds motivated teams across organizational lines and leads their collaboration to success. She sees things differently. She is bold, but not brash. I have tried to sell Heather on a return to aerospace, but she is clear in the marriage of her passions with her professional goals. She would be an extraordinary addition to any organization.
