While her role is as Event Coordinator, she does much more beyond that.

She is always willing to provide information to her team in support of their activities.\n\nOver this past summer she has also stepped into a new role as the intern program leader for NGAS where she has had to demonstrate her ability to be agile in a quickly changing environment and collaborate across the enterprise in a diplomatic fashion.\n\nLastly, she is a strong voice that is oftentimes much needed. She is one that understands our process inside and out, and make that a priority.\n\nOverall, Jenny has provided tremendous support to her team, and the whole enterprise throughout the year, and she has gotten us much further than we would be without her.
