Jenny’s exemplary expertise as the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Logistics and Materiel Readiness (OASD LM&R) webmaster and contracts administrator ensured enhanced, compliant communications and vastly improved support contract execution.  \n \nMy office used the osd.mil domain as the sole repository of department policy, federal regulations, and the annual Department of Defense Maintenance and Foreign Security Force awards. Jenny advised that the site was not compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ensuring federal websites are accessible to those with disabilities. Jenny's seamless conversion plan enabled OASD (L&MR) Section 508 compliance increase from 20% to 100% two months ahead of schedule.  Maintenance policy stakeholders (global mil/civ sr leaders) greatly appreciated the technical and aesthetic improvements and my office benefitted from increased web traffic, lower bounce rate and enhanced site flow and scheme.  Additionally, Jenny's contracting administration talent helped me greatly as the GTR for a $9M (of $56M w/in her purview) support contract. She hit the ground running with the COR and implemented improved contract file management and financial databases easing sequestration affordability drills for all GTRs. Jenny also streamlined the government contractor credentials process for all of ASD L&MR with no disruption in support. \n\n...
