I have been very impressed with his wealth of knowledge and practical experience in the regulation and integration of UA and fully endorse his reputation in the field. As co-chair of the Global Airspace Integration Team, Doug’s focussed yet pragmatic leadership of a diverse team (spanning 2 continents and 4 time zones) has successfully driven forward the debate for the safe introduction of UA into the mainstream Air Traffic environment. Whilst many challenges remain, with his background, expertise and considerable abilities, I am confident that Doug will continue to remain at the forefront of these endeavours.
