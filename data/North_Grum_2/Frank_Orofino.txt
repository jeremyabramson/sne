What I've witnessed in him and his interaction with those that follow his leadership is a style that I personally have attempted to mimic over my tenure as a sales leader.\r\n\r\nIt goes well beyond driving a number.  It goes well beyond maintaining metrics.  It goes well beyond pushing his sales people from behind in an attempt to get them to perform.\r\n\r\nHis most impressive trait as a leader is one simple, immutable, and immeasurable thing;  Brent cares about his people.  He knows their goals, aspirations, families, friends, and he makes sure that they all know his.  He takes the time to know them as a person outside of the walls of their profession and, as a result, the people that have (and will in the future) work for him are willing to run through proverbial walls.  His people have seen immense success, made great money, been promoted all over the organization, and have gone on to achieve the goals that they set out for themselves. \r\n\r\nBrent was born to lead, and if ever presented with the opportunity to be his professional reference, I'd do so with great honor.\n\n...
