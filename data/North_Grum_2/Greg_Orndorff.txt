The Hall-effect thruster systems by design enjoy very high efficiency, Isp, and reliability. Orbion’s versions also break new ground in manufacturing quality and on-orbit lifetime. And you can get these benefits at reduced lead times from order to delivery and at a price point that is compatible with your New Space business model.
