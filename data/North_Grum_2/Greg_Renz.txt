During his service, he was selected to serve on multiple boards due to his in-depth knowledge of diversity and inclusion. Luis’s experience also assisted in the development of the Air National Guard national level diversity marketing campaign. Luis has proven his ability to lead and coach teams to success; through his outstanding leadership, training, and mentoring skills he produced a team of nationally recognized award winners.
