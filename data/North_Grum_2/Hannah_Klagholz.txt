The project is focused on the electrochemical testing of the effect of artificial perspiration on copper, and to ascertain how it tarnishes. The results of this project will assist in the effort to find a non-corrosive copper alloy to replace hospital beds and door handles from stainless steel to copper (to minimize diseases; specifically E. Coli and MRSA)\nResponsibilities have included: researching previous studies using different artificial perspiration solutions available, using electrochemical measurements to measure the thickness of oxides that are produced by soaking samples in the artificial perspiration, working a spectrophotometer to measure the visible tarnishing, using X-ray diffraction to use a non-electrochemical way to confirm electrochemical measurements, using optical microscopy and etching to see the visible differences between the copper alloys that were tarnished.\nsee less","date1":"Jun 2008 – Jun 2011","date2":"3 yrs 1 mo"}],"educations":[{"title":"Purdue University","degree":"Master of Business Administration - MBA","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/18357/?legacySchoolId=18357","date1":"2018","date2":"2020"},{"title":"University of Virginia","degree":"SCHOOL; a B.S","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/19604/?legacySchoolId=19604","fieldOfStudy":"ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCE; Engineering Science; Materials Science","date1":"2007","date2":"2011","description":"Advanced Coursework: Materials Processing, Corrosion Batteries and Fuel Cells, Biomaterials, Electromagnetic and Optical Properties of Materials, Nanoparticles, Structure and Defects of Materials, and Physical Hydrology"}],"skills":[{"title":"Engineering","count":"19"},{"title":"Materials","count":"11"},{"title":"Matlab","count":"7"},{"title":"Technical Writing","count":"7"},{"title":"Characterization","count":"7"},{"title":"Materials Science","count":"6"},{"title":"Data Analysis","count":"5"},{"title":"Simulations","count":"4"},{"title":"Statistics","count":"3"},{"title":"Programming","count":"2"},{"title":"Systems Engineering","count":"1"},{"title":"Design of Experiments","count":"1"},{"title":"Chemical Engineering"},{"title":"Laboratory"},{"title":"Finite Element Analysis"},{"title":"Microsoft Office","count":"4"},{"title":"C++","count":"2"},{"title":"AutoCAD","count":"2"},{"title":"Java","count":"1"},{"title":"Microsoft Excel","count":"1"},{"title":"Labview"},{"title":"SQL"},{"title":"Windows"}],"recommendations":{"givenCount":"0","receivedCount":"0","given":[{}],"received":[]},"accomplishments":[{"count":"2","title":"Publications","items":["Electrochemical Evaluation of Additively Manufactured Alloys and Their Wrought Components for Marine Applications","Mechanical and Electrochemical Evaluation of Ti-6Al-4V Additively Manufactured (AM) Alloys Versus Their Wrought Counterparts"]}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
