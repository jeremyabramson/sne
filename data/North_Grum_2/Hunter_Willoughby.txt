I made RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. I used web data scraping and HTML code parsing. I utilized Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which helped refine skills for exploring and analyzing data. I also used the Folium library to utilize maps of geospatial data and to communicate results and findings.","link":"https://github.com/hunterw17/Coursera-Capstone"}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
