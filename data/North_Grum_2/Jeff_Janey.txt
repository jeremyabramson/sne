I have known and collaborated closely with Jeff for about five years. We first met during his graduate studies (in the Master of Science in the Management of Technology) the flagship program at the Technological Leadership Institute (tli.umn.edu) at the University of Minnesota.\n\nI served as Jeff's instructor in three courses: 1) Pivotal and Emerging Technologies, 2) International Management of Technology Project (held in Delhi and Bangalore, with executive debriefings in Minnesota and India), and 3) the Capstone project. I also served as Jeff's advisor during his 21-month graduate studies and for his Capstone project. Jeff's great energy, synthesis, insights, and creativity applied to hard problems exemplified his pragmatic yet great research skills, his superb communication skills, and solid understanding of the strategy, innovation, \"business of technology,\" how to lead tech-intensive organizations, to move ideas and new products to the global market place impact.\n\nSubsequently we have collaborated on several projects, as Jeff presses forward as an exemplary executive and an insightful and creative leader.\n\nI have also seen Jeff in action on multiple occasions: He works very effectively with a broad range of stakeholders. He is always on top of what is going is going on -- he is well prepared, knows exactly what is in the pipeline, what ramifications they'll have, and who the key stakeholders are, and what practical options are available.\n\nIn summary, I have been very impressed with his commitment to excellence, combined with his tireless yet intelligent work, his solid work ethic – he served in the USAF and his leadership abilities clearly show -- he gets it done effectively and with humility. I am honored to call him an alumnus of our flagship program and a solid leader.
