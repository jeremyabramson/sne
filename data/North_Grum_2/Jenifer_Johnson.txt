Reidel's success at the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network was due to the quality of each and every relationship she built with individual donors and staff.\r\n\r\nReidel is a natural mentor.  Her experiences at the executive level in previous positions she held shined through in her management style and she was constantly mentoring me as I entered a new position as a Corporate and Community Relations Manager for the organization.  Reidel wants her team to shine, and in a time where many people only think of themselves and getting ahead, Reidel would always be the one to provide constructive feedback and \"sing your praises\" to your direct supervisor.  Reidel is invested in the success of those around her, and knows that it takes a team to create change and progress.\r\n\r\nI am so incredibly thankful for the opportunity to work with such an accomplished and passionate individual.

Although I did not report directly to Steve, I collaborated with him on some of the most memorable wishes that we granted for children in Los Angeles County.  \r\n\r\nSteve is extremely talented and experienced when it comes to PR and Marketing, however, what I feel has made him so successful in his career is his compassion and belief in the mission and values of the organizations he works for.  \r\n\r\nAs a Wish Coordinator, I was faced with the challenge of putting together an elaborate belated Sweet16 party for a young girl from San Gabriel Valley.  Steve was so passionate and moved by this young girl and her family that he \"opened up his Rolodex\" and was able to connect me to some of the best vendors and \"movers and shakers\" in Pasadena to host an out of this world party.  With Steve's help, we were able to save thousands of dollars for the Make-A-Wish Foundation without compromising the quality of the wish experience.  It was something that was not in Steve's job description, but his compassion for the Make-A-Wish mission is in his character.  This was not a one time thing and Steve continually assisted with making the wish experiences for our kids outstanding.\r\n\r\nI have since left the Make-A-Wish Foundation to pursue other career opportunities, but I still look to Steve as a mentor and friend.  If the opportunity ever came to work under the leadership of Steve Vanderpool I would jump for the opportunity in a heartbeat.\n\n...
