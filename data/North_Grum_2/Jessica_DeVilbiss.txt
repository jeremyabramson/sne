In our tenure, there is really nothing Shere can’t do well. Shere and I have worked together at 3 companies. She hired and trained me in recruiting at TEKsystems, she led our TA team at Luxottica, and we co-founded and operated a boutique staffing firm Talent Connection together. I have seen Shere is varying company cultures and business scenarios, and I’ve never seen a leader adapt and drive success the way Shere can. Shere is one of those unique and transformative leaders who invests in her people and builds fierce relationships while inspiring her team to achieve exceptional results. Shere also still manages up flawlessly. Her ability to understand the business and her effortless executive presence make her a dream at client management and sales. \n\nShere’s business sense, emotional intelligence and acumen are always spot-on, and there is really no one I trust more for consulting on difficult business challenges. She remains a mentor to me in my professional life, and she has been an invaluable resource to me. Shere flourishes in demanding work cultures and is a master of navigating the grey and finding a way to deliver extraordinary outcomes. Given the opportunity, I would hire, work for or partner with Shere without hesitation!\n\n\n...
