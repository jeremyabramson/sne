I was wrong. What we got was so much more. Stephanie is a natural. She has a way with customers that few have. She can get at the customer's needs and then she understands how to turn those needs into strategic plans that are not only exceptional, but draw the customer to the product. Stephanie quickly went from our MARCOM person to a Business Development lead. What I learned about Stephanie is she is capable of doing anything she puts her mind to. I would not be surprised at all to see her leading a major corporation some day. If her name comes across your desk, you best hire her.
