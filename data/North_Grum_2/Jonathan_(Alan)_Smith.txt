This is accomplished through the use of two Six Sigma sub-methodologies: DMAIC and DMADV. The Six Sigma DMAIC process (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) is an improvement system for existing processes falling below specification and looking for incremental improvement. The Six Sigma DMADV process (define, measure, analyze, design, verify) is an improvement system used to develop new processes or products at Six Sigma quality levels.\"\n\n- Description taken from iSix Sigma"},{"title":"LeTourneau University","degree":"MBA","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/19466/?legacySchoolId=19466","fieldOfStudy":"Finance","date1":"1994","date2":"1996"},{"title":"Howard Payne University","degree":"BBA","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/20503/?legacySchoolId=20503","fieldOfStudy":"Finance/Marketing","date1":"1979","date2":"1983"}],"skills":[{"title":"Program Management","count":"78"},{"title":"Six Sigma","count":"72"},{"title":"Lean Manufacturing","count":"57"},{"title":"Aerospace","count":"46"},{"title":"Manufacturing","count":"42"},{"title":"Continuous Improvement","count":"26"},{"title":"Value Stream Mapping","count":"25"},{"title":"Earned Value Management","count":"23"},{"title":"DMAIC","count":"17"},{"title":"Root Cause Analysis","count":"13"},{"title":"Composites","count":"12"},{"title":"Manufacturing Engineering","count":"12"},{"title":"Aviation","count":"10"},{"title":"Systems Engineering","count":"10"},{"title":"Kaizen","count":"9"},{"title":"Supply Chain Management","count":"9"},{"title":"Analysis","count":"7"},{"title":"Supply Management","count":"7"},{"title":"Operations Management","count":"7"},{"title":"Proposal Writing","count":"6"},{"title":"Engineering","count":"6"},{"title":"Manufacturing Operations","count":"6"},{"title":"Helicopters","count":"5"},{"title":"5S","count":"5"},{"title":"Process Engineering","count":"5"},{"title":"Quality Management","count":"5"},{"title":"MRP","count":"5"},{"title":"Avionics","count":"4"},{"title":"Materials Management","count":"4"},{"title":"DoD","count":"3"},{"title":"Defense","count":"3"},{"title":"Aircraft Maintenance","count":"3"},{"title":"Green Belt","count":"3"},{"title":"Kanban","count":"3"},{"title":"Military","count":"3"},{"title":"Procurement","count":"3"},{"title":"Strategic Sourcing","count":"3"},{"title":"Configuration Management","count":"2"},{"title":"SPC","count":"2"},{"title":"Industrial Engineering","count":"2"},{"title":"Supply Chain","count":"2"},{"title":"Catia","count":"3"},{"title":"Machine Tools","count":"2"},{"title":"Cross-functional Team Leadership","count":"27"},{"title":"Engineering Management","count":"15"},{"title":"Leadership","count":"15"},{"title":"Contract Negotiation","count":"7"},{"title":"Process Improvement","count":"53"},{"title":"Aircraft","count":"21"},{"title":"AS9100","count":"5"}],"recommendations":{"givenCount":"2","receivedCount":"0","given":[{"user":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/larryzakconner/","text":"Zak is an energetic and has customer focused work ethic.
