Jesse was appointed as the IPT Lead for the Guidance and Control Team on an extremely large, airborne, unmanned system for the US Navy.  In this position, Jesse performed exceptionally well and was able to lead the team through a variety of technical and schedule challenges.  His team was recognized for their dedicated support to the program by their employer, as well as by the US Navy.  Much of the team’s success can be attributed to Jesse’s leadership and dedication.  Jesse is a brilliant Guidance and Control engineer and technical leader.  He has the rare ability to analyze problems from various viewpoints and perspectives, weigh alternatives and make rational and educated technical decisions.  He is an exceptional communicator and manages those he leads by example.  I recommend Jesse Koenig to any organization who is seeking a knowledgeable engineer and effective technical leader.\n\n...
