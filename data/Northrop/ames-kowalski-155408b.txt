He’s a proven leader with solid expertise in information technology (IT) and services, I strongly recommend Allen for positions in IT at the director level and above.\n\nAllen’s strategic approach to leadership resulted in tremendous success as he served selflessly in numerous roles during my command at the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base in Rapid City, South Dakota. He was #1 of 4 officers handpicked for executive officer duties, and he was the #1 of 5 unit commanders.\n\nHe used his business acumen and technical knowledge of computer and phone systems to innovate information flow to senior decision makers. When we asked him to tackle the problem of poor reliability in our video teleconferencing services, he restored performance and configuration control, training and empowering others and saving us near $100K annually.\n\nAllen is a top performer who is able to quickly solve problems and take advantage of opportunities. I strongly recommend him.\n\nJames Kowalski, Lieutenant General, USAF (Retired) See less","profileImage":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","name":"Allen Gradnigo, Jr.","userDescription":"To stimulate belonging and success."}]},"accomplishments":[],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
