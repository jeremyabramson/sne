In order to manage such a large amount of satellites I was always developing new ways to use software to automate as many processes as we could.\n\nI was involved in designing and coding Automated Command Procedures (ACPs) that configured the satellites in various ways. I developed a process with a group of software developers to input procedures and output ACPs in the syntax of our ground system. The procedures included the actual commands that get transmitted and executed on board the satellites.\n\nI also lead and managed the Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) Missions for the Space System Loral (SSL) GEO satellites that Intelsat purchased. The cost for these satellites are roughly $250 million + $50 million for the launch. I was involved in seven launches involving 2.1 Billion dollars worth of satellites/launches that I was responsible for during the LEOP Missions.\n\nI developed a process to take documents in the form of procedures, reference documents, training documents, sequence of events, etc... and from those created all the necessary ACPs that the engineering team needed for the LEOP Missions and On-Orbit operations for the typical 15 year lifespan of the satellites.\n\nI also managed and tested all phases of the LEOP Mission plan on Dynamic Satellite Simulators (DSS) and coordinated this plan to a large team of satellite engineers. I also managed all the DSS software and computer network and ensured engineers could, at any time, test ACPs on the DSS, which involved having all the necessary processes up and running for commanding and telemetry.\nsee less","date1":"Jul 2006 – May 2014","date2":"7 yrs 11 mos"},{"title":"Satellite Engineer","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Iridium","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Iridium","companyName":"Iridium","description":"I worked as a Satellite Engineer troubleshooting, process improvement, anomaly resolution, software testing, training, operations support, etc...","date1":"Apr 2001 – Jul 2006","date2":"5 yrs 4 mos"}],"educations":[{"title":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","degree":"Bachelor of Science (BS)","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/19689/?legacySchoolId=19689","fieldOfStudy":"Engineering Mechanics & Astronautics","date1":"1998","date2":"2000"},{"title":"University of Nottingham","degree":"Physics, Maths, Philosophy","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=University%20of%20Nottingham","fieldOfStudy":"Physics, Maths, Philosophy","date1":"1997","date2":"1998","description":"My experience in Nottingham was unparalleled and was my first experience living outside of the US.
