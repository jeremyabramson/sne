One that required us to experiment, collaborate, fail, learn, deliver value and anchor the beginning of true Business Agility. Gabe is truly passionate about going all in to support enterprise change initiative and try new things and refine skills and talents that he has spent years honing and refining. Gabe is a truly curious person and that quality, along with his deep technical and engineering background  (proven by his patents, education, certifications and awards) provided us a space to truly innovate in a way that is not always found in large companies.  He not only encouraged the innovation; he leaned in and was a true partner at a time where heritage leaders might have only participated by traditional, hierarchical methods.  Being a passionate Agilist, a true systems thinker, and someone who values diversity of thought and opinion, Gabe is a valuable team member and leader in any organization.  Gabe was also very supportive and embedded into our continuous learning journey. He is an avid supporter of learning and education and finding opportunities to stretch and grow his and his team's skills and exposure.  That talent provided the foundation of his servant leadership.  As a direct report to Gabe, and as someone that he agreed to work with as an experiment, blossomed into a foundational ecosystem approach for 95,000 employees. Gabe has an unique approach to strategic thinking along with a desire to make the world better.  T am so honored to recommend working with Gabe.  \n\n...
