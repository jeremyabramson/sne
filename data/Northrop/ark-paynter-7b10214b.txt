His primary task was to create and maintain a spreadsheet documenting the pin outs and part numbers of 50 connectors at a major bulkhead. This was not something Norris was familiar with when he started. Norris is an extremely intelligent engineer, and he learns quickly, and can adapt to different disciplines as needed. During this task, Norris was eager to learn about the purpose of each component in the avionics system. The average engineer would be satisfied with matching signal names with no concern of the reasoning behind the name. Norris is far above average. I found him to be more useful and careful than some of our new full time employees. Norris is good with people. He is extremely polite and gracious. Everyone enjoyed working with him and miss him now that he is gone back to school. Norris is very ambitious and I believe he will go far in his career.
