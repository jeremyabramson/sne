He is objective in his assessment of program, client and personnel needs. He appreciates and understands rules and policies frame daily operations; but, he is aware that much of the important work and decisions lie in the grey areas of such rules and policies. He does not hesitate to make decisions and to accept the accountability for such. He considers the input of those who have an interest in an issue and balances complementary and competing demands and expectations with skill. His manner is relaxed and facilitates discussion and open dialogue. He can both lead and follow as the situation warrants, sharing the fruits of his success and never overshadowing the contributions of others.
