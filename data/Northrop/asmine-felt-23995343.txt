Jasmine is highly enthusiastic and hardworking and always looking for new ways to exceed daily's goals. She is a pleasure to work with and has a passion about her career as a manager in your company. Jasmine would always come with a smile on her face and would dedicate her time in completing all of her assigned duties and directing the charmers around to our duties. She is very consistent in her work and goes the extra mile to support Charming Charlie in every shape, way, or form. I have found her to be honest, reliable, hard-working, conscientious and courteous. She works very hard and is dedicated to what she wishes to accomplish. Jasmine is one of those managers that when you go to work and you work with her its actually fun to be around her and do an awesome job in completing tasks so she can be proud of you. Jasmine has been one of my best managers I personally have ever worked with. She is a leader and a teacher as well. Her capacity for passion exceeds and would strongly recommend Jasmine. She is more than capable for the position she is applying for.\n\nJasmine is a hardworking, top-performing ASM professional.
