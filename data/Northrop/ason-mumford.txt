I was recently given a performance award for work which showed how to cut the time it takes a fighter to refuel from a tanker plane by half.\n\nMy work experience has touched on many areas including Monte-Carlo studies, AI, UI/UX, maps, sensors, tracking, and physics modeling. I am continually learning new languages and technologies. Current experience includes Matlab, Python, C#, C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Fortran, PERL, subversion, Objectivity, Wordpress, and development on Windows or Linux.\n\nI value teams, collaboration, and mentoring. I have received many awards over the years for performance and mentoring. I also believe in documenting code, testing, repositories, and other good software practices.\n\nIn addition to my physics/engineering background, I am pursuing a degree in graphic design. I have taken classes on branding, typography, web and mobile development, and UI/UX. As a challenge, I started a T-shirt brand which marries aerospace concepts with modern font and colors.
