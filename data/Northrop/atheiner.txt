He is an articulate communicator, and is at ease in any theatre, albeit technical or non-technical. I had the pleasure of working with Nat on numerous challenging high-level initiatives at the Coast Guard. Nat was an integral executive champion for all information security initiatives, which led to complete executive top-down sponsorship, increased security awareness, and a mature first-rate information security program. Nat encourages and supports the development of future leaders, and would be a perfect addition to any senior executive team in search of a dynamic, charismatic leader.
