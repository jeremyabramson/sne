While Matthew was not one of my direct managers, I did have extensive interactions with him during my time there. Unlike some of the other managers in the program, Matthew had extensive technical knowledge of the software that we were working on. He was constantly looking for ways to improve our current software and he would present his ideas to the program management, as well as our customer. Matthew was also able to communicate with his employees and junior staff very effectively. He held a weekly optional meeting for junior staff to present their ideas, ask questions, or get help. He was the only manager to hold these meetings, and the meetings were open to any employee, regardless if Matthew was their manager. One of Matthew's greatest qualities was that he listened to the junior engineers, and would help them refine their thoughts. This helped junior employees feel engaged and taught them how to take an idea from the point of conception to actually presenting the idea to program management and eventually software development. In short, Matthew was an exceptional manager who was able to keep all of his employees engaged and he was able to directly contribute to the technical advances in our software.
