Past research has shown that social skills are associated with having more accurate and less biased cognitive representations of situations. However, despite the large body of research on social skills, directly observed behavior has been rarely looked at. Participants were brought into the lab to participate in a cooperative task (N = 234), and the current study hypothesized that a social skills composite would be positively associated with items describing a positive social environment. Results show that those who exhibited behaviors associated with social skills were found to interpret this cooperative task as enjoyable and allowing for emotional expression. These findings agree with existing research which show cooperative situations are seen as friendly and intimate, aligning logically with findings that those who are more accurate are more likely to perceive a situation this way.","link":"http://users/kate/Documents/SPSP%20Poster%20pdf%202.pdf"}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
