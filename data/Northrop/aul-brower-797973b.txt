The network will combine the ubiquitous reach of satellite with the speed of fiber to deliver satellite Internet services and mobile backhaul services to emerging markets. The name \"O3b\" stands for \"[The] Other 3 Billion\", referring to the population of the world where broadband Internet is not available without help.\nO3b will primarily serve mobile operators and Internet service providers, providing for voice and data. The network will consist of at least eight Ka-based satellites orbiting at an altitude of 8,000 km, -less than one quarter of the altitude of geostationary satellites- significantly reducing satellite latency. The proximity of the satellites and their use of the Ka band will mean strong performance.\nOn June 25, 2013, O3b launched the first four of a constellation of 8 satellites into orbit; the second four satellites have been launched on July 10, 2014.","link":"http://www.o3bnetworks.com/welcome-to-o3b"}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
