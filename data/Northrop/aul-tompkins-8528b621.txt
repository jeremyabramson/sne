In that role, Mike was instrumental in many significant developments, analyses and operations supporting both Cargo Dragon (via the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation System - COTS - and Commercial Resupply Services - CRS programs) and Crew Dragon (via the NASA Commercial Crew Program). Mike is competent technically, and is always eager to learn what he doesn't know to adapt himself to the next challenge. During our time at SpaceX, that ranged from extending his knowledge of orbital dynamics theory; understanding existing guidance, navigation and control algorithms on Dragon; to learning C++, Python and web-based technologies to enhance his capabilities and productivity.\n\nWithin Mission Operations, Mike acted as a crossover between our team and the GNC development team. Embedded in GNC, among other projects, he helped design Dragon planning algorithms, conducted countless analyses to show that Dragon's operations would be safe in proximity to the International Space Station, and developed code to be used in the representation of trajectories and related data on crew displays for astronauts flying onboard Dragon.\n\nOne of Mike's core efforts was in the automation of recurring analyses needed to support mission planning, and pre-flight verification for our NASA customer. Through this work, Mike was personally responsible for saving our department dozens of analysis person-hours per flight, and also, by deploying web-based data interfaces for many of the analyses, he exposed the analysis results to a far greater segment of the company, thereby enhancing communications and consistency in the use of these products.\n\nAs a member of Mission (now Space) Operations embedded in the GNC team, another of Mike's responsibilities was to make sure that the algorithms, tools and processes being developed by GNC would ultimately be \"operable\" by those doing the planning and on-console flight operations for Dragon. He was very good at working with members of the SpaceX GNC and Mission Operations teams, as well as with NASA, to make sure our operations were achievable, highly efficient with manpower, and sustainable.\n\nMichael is a very personable guy, passionate about his work, and has deep integrity. He is reasonable, is a very strong communicator, he stands up for what he believes in, and was well-respected both with SpaceX and with our NASA customer as someone who would listen and adopt good ideas from others, but who would also stand his ground, when appropriate, to make sure we were heading in the right direction technically.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Michael Barrucco for any future endeavor he might want to take on.
