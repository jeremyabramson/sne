While normal interns might be content to pass the time, Lauren was not. Our team was struggling with many things, however once Lauren joined, things turned around. Her enthusiasm to learn and make things happen was contagious and positively influenced the team. While she was there as a mechanical engineer working on radio housing parts, she was more of a leader or manager to the team. She led design efforts and regularly brought other team members into her design review to make sure their input was considered for the design. She has a wonderful way of motivating people to do better and to achieve more than the minimum, this is a rare skill.\nHaving stayed in touch with Lauren since the internship, my impression of her has only grown, she has the all the attributes of a great leader, it is clear that she will do amazing things in her career.\nSee less","profileImage":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","name":"Ricky Houghton","userDescription":"Stealth Startup at Still in Stealth Mode"},{"user":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-barr-88368739/","text":"If you have an opportunity to bring Sara on to your team, make a wise decision and do it!
