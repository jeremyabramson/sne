Part of this includes using probabilistic programming techniques combined with graph analysis for decision optimization. Another is deep learning techniques for clustering datasets combined with classification to turn unstructured data into a useful tool for cyber analysts.\n\nThis work has allowed me to serve in a leadership role at times, pushing research forward and handling tasking for multiple team members.\n\nDevelopment languages utilized include Java, Python, and Scala.\nsee less","date1":"Jun 2017 – May 2019","date2":"2 yrs","location":"McLean, VA"}]},{"title":"Student Researcher","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/christopher-newport-university/","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/christopher-newport-university/","companyName":"Christopher Newport University","location":"NASA Langley Research Center","description":"• Worked with a team of data scientists and programmers within the Atmospheric Science Data Center at NASA, developing an enhanced Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm to match atmospheric data files for a knowledge base. Resulted in publication for an international IEEE conference.\n• Investigated other approaches to the problem, comparing the NB algorithm to others including classification trees with bagging and boosting. Comparison is pending publication at the ICAI '17 conference in July.\n• Developed a parser to convert older atmospheric data files in the AMES format into the newer ICARTT standard. Utilized regular expressions, PyParsing in Python, and web scrapers.\nsee less","date1":"Feb 2015 – May 2017","date2":"2 yrs 4 mos"},{"title":"Engineering Intern","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/newport-news-shipbuilding-a-division-of-huntington-ingalls-industries/","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/newport-news-shipbuilding-a-division-of-huntington-ingalls-industries/","companyName":"Newport News Shipbuilding, A Division of Huntington Ingalls Industries","location":"Newport News, VA","description":"Department E88 Nuclear Propulsion - Engineering Support\n\nWorked with a team of database administrators to create, repair, and improve hundreds of databases for an entire division of the shipyard, via extensive utilization of Microsoft Access and Visual Basic programming.\nsee less","date1":"May 2014 – Aug 2014","date2":"4 mos"},{"title":"Visitor Services Associate","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Virginia%20Air%20and%20Space%20Center","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Virginia%20Air%20and%20Space%20Center","companyName":"Virginia Air and Space Center","location":"Hampton, VA","description":"Helped customers through different facets of the museum, from working the cafe to running the Hampton Carousel.","date1":"Jun 2012 – Aug 2013","date2":"1 yr 3 mos"}],"educations":[{"title":"Christopher Newport University","degree":"Master’s Degree","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/19570/?legacySchoolId=19570","fieldOfStudy":"Computer Science","date1":"2015","date2":"2017","description":"Five-Year Master's program at CNU"},{"title":"Christopher Newport University","degree":"Bachelor’s Degree","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/19570/?legacySchoolId=19570","fieldOfStudy":"Computer Science and Computer Engineering","date1":"2012","date2":"2016","description":"Magna Cum Laude\nHonors Program Graduate\nAcademic Dean's List 2012-2016"}],"skills":[{"title":"Teamwork","count":"10"},{"title":"Research","count":"6"},{"title":"Java","count":"4"},{"title":"Software Documentation"},{"title":"Social Media"},{"title":"C++","count":"3"},{"title":"Visual Basic","count":"1"},{"title":"Computer Hardware","count":"1"},{"title":"Windows","count":"5"},{"title":"SQL","count":"1"},{"title":"Microsoft Office","count":"11"},{"title":"Access","count":"1"},{"title":"HTML","count":"2"},{"title":"Databases"},{"title":"PHP","count":"1"},{"title":"PowerPoint","count":"1"},{"title":"Microsoft Excel"},{"title":"Microsoft Word","count":"1"},{"title":"Linux"},{"title":"Customer Service","count":"5"},{"title":"Leadership","count":"4"},{"title":"Management","count":"1"},{"title":"Process Improvement"},{"title":"Social Networking","count":"2"}],"recommendations":{"givenCount":"0","receivedCount":"0","given":[{}],"received":[]},"accomplishments":[{"count":"23","title":"Courses","items":["Algorithms","Android Mobile Computing","Artificial Intelligence I","C++ Programming","Communications I","Communications II","Computer Architecture","Computer Engineering Design","Computer Science/Engineering Capstones","Computers and Programming I/II","Cryptography and Network Security","Data and File Structures","Design of Experiments","Digital Logic Design","Digital System Design","Electronics","Foundations of Computer Science","General Physics","Methods of Theoretical Physics","Object Oriented Program and Design"]},{"count":"1","title":"Language","items":["English"]},{"count":"1","title":"Organization","items":["Upsilon Pi Epsilon"]},{"count":"1","title":"Publication","items":["Measurement classification using hybrid weighted Naive Bayes"]}],"courses":[{"name":"Algorithms","year":"CPSC 420"}],"languages":[{"name":"English","proficiency":"Native or bilingual proficiency"}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
