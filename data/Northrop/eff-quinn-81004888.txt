I watched him attract new customers through calls, referrals and subcontractors while simultaneously bidding dozens of jobs while also maintaining Hanard Machine's quality system to Boeing requirements, and evangelizing the company's executive team to participate in ISO Continuous Improvement activities while still finding time to meet with existing customers on a regular basis.  I've worked at several companies as a successful Manufacturing Engineer in fields ranging from composites layup and bonding, metals machining and bonding, aerostructure assembly and final finishing for many new aircraft on a contract and direct basis.  I have yet to meet a more complete and effective manager than Loren Paulsen anywhere I've worked.  He seemed more like a business owner in his total commitment to the projects he brought in.  The subtle skills I absorbed from him have always been helpful and I'm thankful to have been the lucky Co-op to be chosen to shadow him at Hanard Machine, years ago.  It wasn't always easy, but neither is being among the best.\n\n...
