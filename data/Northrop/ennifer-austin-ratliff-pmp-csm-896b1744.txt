Our program requirements are difficult, our pace of work is fast, and our demand for consistent high performance is unrelenting. Jennifer‘s excellent performance as a project manager and ability to build relationships on a series of key programs contributed significantly to our business success. I am very pleased to offer a letter of recommendation on her behalf.\nJennifer has been a full-time employee of the Northrop Grumman Corporation since 2010. She is a professional project manager. As a senior executive, colleague and CDC team member, I have had an opportunity to directly observe Jennifer’s job performance—it is superior—she consistently brings excellence to all her professional endeavors.\nHer main areas of project management have been projects within the immunization systems division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Jennifer managed four separate teams of nationally recognized technical, clinical and academic experts from the immunization and health information technology communities. She developed formal project plans, monitored progress, supervised employees, facilitated work, solved problems, created deliverables, and implemented sustainability processes which would be maintained by the CDC customer. Additionally, she has supported Northrop Grumman through division-wide presentations regarding her project work, attended conferences to represent Northrop and CDC, and has delivered conference presentations. She was recognized as a Northrop Grumman “Star Performer” in 2012. In 2013, she helped close out a series of difficult programs while helping Northrop posture for future work.\nJennifer brings intelligence, energy and depth of experience to all of her professional undertakings. While Jennifer’s specific expertise is in complex project management, I have also found her to have a deep overall knowledge of business administration. She has been creative and responsive in leveraging business resources to benefit customer operations.\nIn summary, Jennifer has an excellent professional reputation and is well respected by her customers and peers.

He has worked with me at Northrop Grumman on an engagement that I managed involving an assessment of patient de-duplication practices among nationwide Immunization Information Systems (IIS).  He conducted one-on-one interviews with subject matter experts from the immunization community and academia to form an expert panel of 20 individuals.  He prepared materials for and facilitated all in-person and remote working sessions with that panel throughout the course of the effort.  Fred designed and implemented a nationwide assessment of current patient de-duplication practices among the IIS community.  He consolidated all panel input and documented a best practices report.  He led the efforts to bring previously developed test cases up to current industry standards, and he developed a report to accompany the test cases and summarize best practices around testing as well.  \r\nAs a colleague, I have had an opportunity to observe Dr. Grant’s performance which I’ve found to be superior. Fred is very personable and communicates effectively with everyone at all experience and education levels.  He is clearly a leader and was a mentor to many members of the project team. Fred’s facilitation skills are outstanding.  The project had several expert panels, but the patient de-duplication panel was the most responsive and engaged as a result of Fred’s strong ability in this area.  Fred is excellent at writing in terms of his ability to pull comprehensive information together.   Due to his extensive research abilities, Fred was very quickly regarded by the panel and project team as an expert in patient de-duplication.  Fred is outstanding at developing very professional academic reports and conference presentations.  He presented on the project’s patient de-duplication work at the 2012 American Public Health Association conference.  Fred’s ability in this area was a unique talent on the project team and was highly valued by the customer.  The customer wanted to leverage Fred in other areas of the project as a result of this skill.  Overall, Fred was a pleasure to work with.  We could not have executed the project effectively without his commitment, professionalism and leadership.\n\n...
