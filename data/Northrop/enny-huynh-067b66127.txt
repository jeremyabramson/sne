In addition, I’m always willing to learn new skills that can further enhance or improve my career as an engineer and hopefully, one day I will be able to use those new skills to make the world a better place for people to live in.\n\nOn my free time, i like to learn and self teach myself calculus, physics and circuits. I taught myself calculus 1,2,3, circuit 1, circuit 2, electronics 1, and electronics 2.\n\nI have always been fascinated with electricity and excelled in mathematics, thus how i chose my major.
