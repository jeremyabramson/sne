He is an outstandng individual that works very hard, smart, talented and brings a lot of manufacturing knowledge with him from his vast background and many years of experience. He works great in any team setting and is always willing and capable of taking on any level of tasks, problems, and process related issues. For example, one particular situation I recall is when he took over a ribbon bond cell that was on it's last leg and out dated in terms of being a six sigma process. He revamped it and brought it up to current industries standards by instituting the following, setting up Project hardware schedules, continuous product flow, TPM, bottleneck elimination, implementing cycle time and defect reduction practices. In his current role as a Senior Manufacturing Engineer, He is leading a critical team of Manufacturing Operations and Quality team members at executing on a Program to very aggressize cost, schedule, and risk reduction goals.
