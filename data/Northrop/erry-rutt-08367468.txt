In addition to his management skilld, his technical knowledge is at the top of the of all the engineers that worked for me. He is fanatastic at interfacing with the customer and was able to help create a new DARPA program for high speed missiles that has evolved into a program worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Raytheon and a half of a billion dollars for the customer and industry. He is an excellent capture manager, writer, presenter and proposal lead and has multiple wins.  After he wins the programs he expertly executes them using his management skills including his superb EVMS knwledge.\r\nI highly recommend Steve for a management, systems engineering or software engineering position.\r\n\r\nJerry Rutt\n\n...
