As our team lead, Meg always made sure we had the tools we needed to be the best at what we do daily and if she didn't have the answer, she would make good use of her resources until she found the right answer.  We were lucky to have a very detailed, organized, motivated and dedicated lead in Meg.  She worked very hard to create standard operating procedures for new and existing processess which hadn't been captured.  During this time, the department was experiencing many changes such as re-orgs and a sector merger.  Thanks to the captured procedures, our group was able to stay organized, trained and engaged.  \r\n\r\nMeg also supported the team on a constant basis with any opportunities that would come up for us to engage or participate in different projects. Her motivation and creativity when creating new team building exercises is very admirable. \r\n\r\nIt was great pleasure working with Meg who is very missed and we thank her for leaving behind excellent tools that we continue to use every day.\n\n...
