Tom's contribution to the F-35 program was very significant. Tom's is extremely creative and is driven to get results that matter. His enthusiasm rubs off on colleagues and he is an enabler of increasing the momentum and rhythm of the team he is associated with.

Rosso is a knowledgeable and productive contributor, very engaging, and a pleasure to work with. Rosso managed the agile development of the QC Toolkit, spanning elements from Enterprise Architect, Magillem / IP-XACT, and SystemC / OSCI. Model builds were generated to execute in both Linux and Windows. Rosso supported staged releases of toolkit functionality, while managing other contributors involved with the development of infrastructure tools. Rosso has a great work ethic, can-do  attitude, and was a very dependable steward for the development and release process for a complex toolchain.
