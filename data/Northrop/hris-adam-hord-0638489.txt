As my Assistant NCOIC of Intelligence, Adam was responsible for providing daily current intelligence briefings to squadron personnel and leadership and enemy weapon systems briefings to squadron aircrew. He is also responsible for coordinating with other government agencies concerning current and future operational capabilities for our squadron and making recommendations to squadron leadership. As of late, he is managing our squadron personnel security program. Due to Adam's efforts, the squadron security program is \"leaps and bounds\" from where it was 6 months ago when he took over. Adam possesses a wealth of experience and knowledge and would succeed in any work environment!

He provided exemplary support for the systems he was in charge of and had a vast amount of knowledge that we tapped frequently. In addition to being extremely bright, he had a great ability to solve problems unconventionally and creatively. I'm thrilled to have had Shean as a colleague and now to call him a friend. Any company would benefit greatly from his experience, knowledge and skill set.\n\n...
