I first realized that I was on this trajectory when, as a first year Engineering PhD student, I found myself more interested in attending an accounting class than working on my dissertation. Ever since then I’ve had a passion for driving business growth through digital transformation, whether managing P&L execution for next-gen digital sensor systems, leading a cloud/information system rollout, or engineering an embedded computer system.\n\nAfter starting my career as a computer systems architect and a technical project manager I went off to business school and then transitioned to a role in Investment Banking. Entering the business just before the credit markets collapsed in 2008 and having to work through a difficult time in the industry not only taught me a lot about deal making and customer engagement but also how to think about risk management and its impact on business success.\n\nLater in my career I was able to grow a large IT information systems, infrastructure and support organization (>140 people and $60 million budget), managing through a number of cultural and integration challenges to build a high-performance team. As an intrapreneur within a large defense contractor I led the strategy, business case and project execution for a digital transformation initiative that provided advanced software systems and business process transformation to thousands of Engineering and Manufacturing employees.\n\nIn my most recent role I have been focused on P&L execution, program management, and new business growth, where I’ve led a cross-functional team through strategy creation, investment allocation and product development for a next-generation digital sensor architecture. These sensor capabilities form the foundation for several national security programs exceeding $2B in future lifecycle revenue.\n\nI’m a fitness buff (I exercise almost daily) and enjoy cycling when I can get the bike out. I’m also a voracious reader and listen to podcasts whenever I get a few minutes of downtime.\n\nUS citizen with active DoD TS/SCI security clearance."},"about":{"text":"I’ve always had simultaneous interests in computer systems, technology and business and have spent most of my career at the intersection of these domains.
