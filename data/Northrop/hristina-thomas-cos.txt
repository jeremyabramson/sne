Tisha is very passionate about what she does and she will always be the first one to show up at the start of a project and the last one to leave -- only when the job is finished. Tisha is a natural leader and is very creative and innovative, and she is always working on improving herself and finding better avenues for accomplishing tasks, increasing productivity and constantly improving the company she works for or group that she's a part of. Tisha has been through many challenging times in her life and has continued to overcome them with vigor. She has only grown stronger and consistently shown that there is no challenge that she can't conquer. I offer Tisha my highest recommendation and would hire her or appoint her to any position, regardless of whether she already possesses the appropriate experience or not. She is a very fast learner and can tackle any task presented to her. Any company or organization would be lucky to have Tisha as a part of their team.\n\n...

The 2013 camp incorporated activities designed to inform youth about HIV/AIDS, how HIV is transmitted, how they can protect themselves from contracting it, the importance of healthy relationships, and the negative effects of stigma and discrimination and how they can help combat this. Fifty-five students in grades 8 and 10 attended lessons daily lessons on the camp topic, participated in team-building activities, and learned various songs, dances, and games aimed at improving their English language skills and broadening their awareness of American culture while sharing their own culture through interaction with American Peace Corps Volunteers. By the end of the camp the students displayed an outstanding knowledge of HIV transmission methods, healthy relationships, and ways to fight stigma and discrimination. According to pre- and post-tests administered, there was a 22% increase in knowledge/awareness about HIV/AIDS among the students at the camp and the students were also introduced to a minimum of 50 new English terms related to the camp topic.\n\nThe students chosen to attend the camp live in southern Ukraine in the Mykolayivs'ka region. Mykolayiv is known as one of the regions with the highest rate of HIV transmission in Ukraine, which in turn has the most severe HIV epidemic in the whole Eastern Europe and Central Asia\n\nOn the last day of the camp the students performed an HIV awareness and charity concert in the local town square where they collected donations to be given to a local organization that works with people living with HIV.\n\nAs its second year in existence the Leaders of the Future Camp continues to build the capacity of the local teachers involved as well as the Director of the Bereznehuvate Community Charitable Foundation, \"Berehynia,\" which was the lead organization in the project, to organize and implement an educational camp.","link":"http://www.bridge2ukraine.org/"}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[{"title":"HS Girls' Soccer Coach","experience":"THOMAS MACLAREN STATE CHARTER SCHOOL","date1":"Feb 2016 – May 2017","date2":"1 yr 4 mos"},{"title":"Board Secretary and Curriculum Development","experience":"Bridge to Ukraine","description":"Civil Rights and Social Action","date1":"Apr 2013 – Jul 2016","date2":"3 yrs 4 mos"},{"title":"RPCV Alliance for Ukraine","experience":"National Peace Corps Association","date1":"Jan 2018 – Present","date2":"3 yrs 2 mos"}],"contact":[]}
