Then our paths crossed again when I spoke at CSULB.  Tim was the organizer of the meeting.  In the conduct of his task he demonstrated excellent leadership skills, speaking skills and professionalism.  I spoke with one of his instructors and learned that he was considered a top student.  Tim is hands on engineer having worked on several projects while in school, the kind of person that likes to get his hands dirty.  It is great to see a young man grow through scouts, into college and end up as a positive contributor to society.
