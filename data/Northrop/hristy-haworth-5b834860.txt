The VT-F is an economical, regional turboprop airliner that transports 70 passengers at the lowest operating cost currently offered by aircraft of its class. The VT-F is a technologically advanced aircraft seamlessly integrating the benefits of high efficiency engines, electrical subsystems, and lightweight structures to create a synergistic aircraft system. Volterra Aerospace has achieved an innovative design towards an environmentally responsible aircraft that has reduced operating costs.\n\nA reduction in jet fuel burn is achieved through the implementation of advanced low fuel consumption turboprop engines which results in a significantly reduced operating cost. Additionally, the VT-F utilizes electric subsystems thereby removing the need for bleed air resulting in reduced fuel burn and maintained engine efficiency. VT-F’s semi-composite construction and lightweight cabin interiors have a 15% overall reduction to operating weight empty. With a lowered structural weight the VT-F is a smaller, lighter, and more fuel efficient aircraft than has been previously seen on the market. Finally, the VT-F is a more environmentally friendly aircraft, emitting 1/3 of the nitrogen oxide emissions of current competitors and fewer carbon dioxide emissions than any aircraft of its class. Volterra Aerospace is looking forward to seeing the VT-F surge to the forefront of the regional transport airline marketplace revolutionizing the industry as a result of its superior economic and environmental advantages.","link":"https://www.aiaa.org/Secondary.aspx?id=344"}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
