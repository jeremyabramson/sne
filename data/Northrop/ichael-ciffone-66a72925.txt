He’s a veteran of Redondo Beach and his expertise on the neighborhood, schools, and market was invaluable. He brought everything to the experience that you’d expect from your real estate agent and more – he took time to thoroughly educate and advise us at every step of the process, he brought creative solutions to the table upon writing and closing, he had savvy insights on the construction and design potential of all houses we walked through, and he was always a voice of reason and optimism when the search felt frustrating (five bids, competitive seller’s market, it happens). During the bidding process, he provided the push we needed to take sensible risks, but balanced that with transparent guidance on where not to take risks as well. And upon closing on our home, his connections enabled the sellers to resolve an issue that was uncovered on their up-leg and avoid derailing escrow. The level of integrity that David brings to this very personal and significant life moment is his utmost strength. It gave us confidence that we’d find the perfect house for our growing family through COE Real Estate Team and we did!\n\n...
