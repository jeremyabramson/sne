From the start, and actually before his first day, Larif demonstrated ambition, dedication, and a strong work ethic by going above and beyond his job duties.\r\n\r\nFor example, Larif took it upon himself to begin learning about Maryland procurement regulations, advisories, and flagship contracts prior to starting his job. By establishing that foundation on his own, it quickly led to the management team mentoring him to develop a specialty in sophisticated software contracts.  In just a short amount of time, Larif became a very valuable asset to the procurement team, his management, and the State.    \r\n\r\nAs his previous manager, I took great comfort in knowing that any assignment that went his way would be performed diligently, professionally, and gracefully.  He consistently met deadlines that were challenging and he demonstrated leadership among his colleagues.

Her ambition to effect improvement and efficiency is truly one of a kind.  As an example, Stacia repeatedly queried the Department Executives to make investments in her staff.  In just a short amount of time, the staff grew by several positions, with each person developing a specialty in IT contracting.  The staff enjoyed team building and training events that encouraged each to hone their skills.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, in just a short amount of time she has given more to the State than anyone who held her position in the past.
