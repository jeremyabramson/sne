My Innovative Design Engineering major that allowed me to exercise and refine my creative skill set when it comes to product design. As I started graduate school, I knew that an MBA would serve me well, but I couldn't walk away from engineering either. I know it is not only important to design a great product, but by me managing programs to fit within cost and schedule constraints are main contributors of success of the program and customer satisfaction.\n\nNow, I get to design, see, and touch airplanes everyday at Northrop Grumman. The complexity and capability of the products I have gotten to work on still leave me with a sense of awe and wonderment.
