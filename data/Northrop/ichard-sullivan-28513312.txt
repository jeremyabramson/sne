His systems engineering execution is thorough and enabled the team to be a proactive supplier to our prime and positively recognized by our prime's customer.\r\nAs further indication of his excellence, he leveraged his L-3 experience into the space industry changing careers to Space Systems Loral and was responsible for leading the development of communication satellite payloads. During his tenure, he co-authored a chapter in \"Space Mission Engineering\", which is a book used in internal training to teach my peers at NGC Space Systems on Mission Engineering.  Similarly in his drive of the betterment of his hometown has become one of the city Commissioners at the request of his city mayor. This doesn't just happen. \r\nEd has phenomenal \"born leader\" leadership skills and can take charge of any situation with demonstrated senior leadership capability.  I do believe that he can leverage his abilities to any scenario that needs a difficult problem solved and represents his team, his company, and himself to very high standards.\n\n...
