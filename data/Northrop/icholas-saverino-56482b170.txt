Initially started as a shipping coordinator through our online sales platform, Crystal Commerce and TCGPlayer. After a month, my primary lead was to ensure all mail was delivered daily as well as sending messages or responding to concerns from customers. I was able to reshape the shipping department to what it has become and increasing positive rating from 99.5% to 99.9% in 2 months; it has continued that trend for the past 3 years. After moving to sales representative and away from shipping, I was promoted to manager in early 2018. Primary goals include buying and selling based on memorization of prices of the market. My goal as manager was to ensure all employees were up to date on all tasks and software. Morale was important to me as well as positive customer interactions.\nsee less","date1":"Nov 2015 – Dec 2018","date2":"3 yrs 2 mos"}],"educations":[{"title":"University of Maryland Baltimore County","degree":"Bachelor of Science - BS","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/18569/?legacySchoolId=18569","fieldOfStudy":"Environmental Science and Geography","date1":"2011","date2":"2019"}],"skills":[{"title":"ARCGis"},{"title":"IPC-600 Certification"},{"title":"Multilayer Technician"},{"title":"Sales"},{"title":"Python (Programming Language)"},{"title":"R"},{"title":"Customer Service"}],"recommendations":{"givenCount":"0","receivedCount":"0","given":[{}],"received":[]},"accomplishments":[],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
