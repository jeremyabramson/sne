Focuses on the material and process qualification of the fuselage-mounted E-glass/Epoxy composite slide compartment/panel, compressed gas inflation system, and the pneumatic release system holding the panel to the compartment during flight. Interfaces with international customer, Embraer, for technical discussions, requirement negotiations, and execution of hardware deliveries. Writes and executes material test plans to ensure the fabricated components and systems function as expected from design analyses. Works extensively with the composite compartment/panel manufacturer to ensure the parts are being fabricated per the design requirements and that the materials will meet all customer requirements. Continuously evaluates the composite design for robustness, weight optimization, and overall effectiveness as a reliable housing for the evacuation slide during the +15 year service life of the system.\nsee less","date1":"Apr 2015 – Nov 2016","date2":"1 yr 8 mos"},{"title":"Senior Propulsion Engineer","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/atk/","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/atk/","companyName":"Orbital ATK","location":"Chandler, AZ","description":"As a Propulsion Engineer, Mr. Baglini supports technical activities as part of a multi-discipline launch vehicle team.
