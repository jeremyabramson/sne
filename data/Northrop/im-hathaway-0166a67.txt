The Programs included the design & development of several prototype High Power SSPA Units from 2-18 GHz and 18-40GHz intended for a wideband airborne EW application. The product was based on an all GaN MMICs solution. For another program, we delivered thousands of high performance navigation and IFF components and PWB assemblies for a Avionics environment. I also managed a Space based Radiometer effort. We designed, tested and delivered 16 IMAs in the K, Ka, V and W bands. Another effort I led was were our team designed and produced 212 RF Receiver units for the avionics ISR environment. The unit uses integrated microwave assemblies, hybrids, and a circuit board assembly, is very high performance, and has seen no on-mission failures since 2007! During this time period, I also led a few interesting studies, such as a phased array communications antenna unit that covered various GHz bands and was intended for an avionics environment. Also investigated was an ultra compact wideband frequency converter unit intended for the terrestrial environment. The third was a wideband antenna aperture intended for avionics environment. The total value of the delivered hardware and documentation for all programs was approximately $165M USD over the past 12 years.\nsee less","date1":"Nov 2006 – Sep 2018","date2":"11 yrs 11 mos","location":"Southern California"},{"title":"6 Sigma Black Belt","description":"Space Technology Leadership Development program and process improvement effort.

Let me explain a bit - I was working on a challenging pre-production project and needed several high performance components ASAP.  I was spending an in-ordinate amount of time searching and calling around, when I happened to make a connection with Tony.  What fortunate luck! Tony was able to get me technical advice and suggestions, and ended up sourcing all the key component of my system, many of which that everyone said was no longer available! Once everything arrived, the engineering team was able to take it from there and we met the schedule with a few days to spare.
