Every single stack required rework prior to shipping to meet the tight production deadlines at Haas.

Lina’s ability to value and truly partner with us as a vendor kept the production lines and the costs down by eliminating unnecessary overtime costs.\n\nDue to Lina’s integrity, dependability and excellent potential, I would heartily recommend Lina for a managerial or supervisor position.
