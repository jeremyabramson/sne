On both engineering groups he excelled with impressive speed and ingenuity without loosing track of details. At cymer our manager and I thought it was a big loss to see him leave. He was the fastest designer in the group and fast is as important in the semiconductor industry as the details. At ISE he was also a great asset to the design team. He took on design projects with a positive attitude and open to criticism to make the results better. Personally he is quiet/attentive and very respectful. I would recommend him for a mechanical engineer or designer position without hesitation. He now has many years of experience with Pro/e, Intralink, Windchill design products as well as oracle's agile, FEA, pro cabling and other such tools that I've known him to be very useful at.

He is enthusiastic and passionate about committing perfection in various CAD application. His customized application and executable programs towards general CAD environment, PLM, and PDM for corporation's specific business needs is much beyond what is\r\nstrictly needed for covering the prescribed mechanical engineer's scope. He has evinced an aptitude for both mechanical engineering and computer languages is well versed in Java, Pearl and C++. Though the mechanical engineering does not prescribe software manipulation as a prerequisite\r\nfor the recognition of the mechanical aspect. I would classify Alfonso Medina’s abilities to excel and go beyond his academic background clearly makes him more outstanding and successful as an engineer and CAD administrator.\n\n...
