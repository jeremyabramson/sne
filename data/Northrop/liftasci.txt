He grasps complex problems by asking the right questions and comes up the most outside of the box yet simple solutions. Most importantly, he explains his approach in a very clear, methodical way to people at all levels. Aside from his technical strength, Prashanth also establishes very good relationship with his colleagues and superiors. I found him always very approachable and fun to work with.
