In all of my interactions with her, I found her to be professional, authentic, and incredibly helpful. Beyond the text contained in a job description, she really took the time to hone in on the nuances of what we were looking for in candidates. As a result, I was usually presented with a slate of solid candidates on the first try. In and of themselves, her results brought success; but I couldn't put a price tag on the value she created for me in the form of time saved. Further, that she was able to this from a different office location than mine says a great deal about her ability to remotely build a rapport, engagement, and trust. No mean feat. Not only would I extend a recommendation, but I'd also say that Amanda would be an asset to any team fortunate enough to have her.
