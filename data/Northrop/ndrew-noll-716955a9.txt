This rotation exposed me to nonlinear RF circuit analysis, best practices for RF board layout, and 3D component modeling in FEM based commercial simulation tools.\n\nMy second rotation furthered my understanding of developing and analyzing FEM models, such as radiators, filters, and couplers. I developed an interest in analyzing antenna patterns, and used MATLAB extensively to understand how multiple antenna elements interact with each other in large arrays.\n\nI'm currently in my third rotation in the RF Subsystem Design & Test organization.\nsee less","date1":"Jan 2018 – Present","date2":"3 yrs 2 mos"},{"title":"Hardware Engineering Intern","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/northrop-grumman-corporation/","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/northrop-grumman-corporation/","companyName":"Northrop Grumman","location":"Baltimore, Maryland Area","description":"My main task was to develop an RF model from schematic drawings and analyze the model's RF performance. After determining the initial system would not meet specifications, I assisted in altering the model to best improve performance while minimizing system complexity. The final results of my analysis matched those of a built demo unit, and helped provide justification to fund a production effort for the system.\n\nThis project helped me understand how systems can change during the design process. During the course of my analysis and testing, I also strengthened my skills with ADS, HFSS, and MATLAB.\nsee less","date1":"May 2017 – Jul 2017","date2":"3 mos"},{"title":"Intern","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/pk-electrical/","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/pk-electrical/","companyName":"PK Electrical","location":"Reno, Nevada Area","description":"This internship marked my first electrical engineering position. I helped develop building models for photometric analysis, which were used to ensure illumination levels in proposed building drawings met the required levels stated in the NEC. I also updated AutoCAD drawings based on revisions made to distribution system and lighting system layouts.","date1":"Jun 2016 – Jul 2016","date2":"2 mos"}],"educations":[{"title":"The Ohio State University","degree":"Bachelor of Science (B.S.)","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/19133/?legacySchoolId=19133","fieldOfStudy":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","date1":"2014","date2":"2017","description":"Relevant OSU Coursework:\n\nMicrowave Engineering (ECE 5017)\nMicrowave Electronics (ECE 5027)\nRadio Frequency Integrated Circuits (ECE 5022)\nAntennas (ECE 5011)\nWireless Networking (ECE 5101)\nAnalog Integrated Circuits (ECE 5021)\nOrganic Semiconducting Materials (ECE 5833)\nDigital Signal Processing (ECE 5200)\nScientific Computing with MATLAB (MATH 3607)\nC/C++ Programming (ECE 1222)\nTechnical Communication (ENGR 2367)"}],"skills":[{"title":"Agilent ADS"},{"title":"MATLAB","count":"1"},{"title":"Ansys HFSS"},{"title":"Technical Documentation"},{"title":"C"},{"title":"C++"},{"title":"VHDL"},{"title":"PHP"},{"title":"Java"},{"title":"Microsoft Office"},{"title":"RF & Microwave Design"},{"title":"Circuit Analysis"},{"title":"RF Engineering"},{"title":"CST Microwave Studio"}],"recommendations":{"givenCount":"0","receivedCount":"0","given":[{}],"received":[]},"accomplishments":[{"count":"1","title":"Honor & Award","items":["Volunteer Service Award"]}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
