During this time, I found him to be incredibly forward-looking, anticipating requirements, and very effectively negotiating with the Government to get the maximum benefit for us under the contract.  His organizational skills are second-to-none, he could put his fingers on any one document on a highly complex contract consistring of dozens of Delivery Orders in a matter of seconds.  He was always a pleasure to work with, taking his job, but never himself, very seriously.  I'm proud to count Mick among my friends, and would seek to work with him again.\r\n-Bob Maszarose\n\n...
