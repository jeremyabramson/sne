Originally Maribel was brought in as a leader for our compensation and benefits group at our plant  in Tijuana, MX. In this role, she helped stabilize and improve both our payroll operations and procedures, as well as manage and enhance our various employee benefits offerings. \r\n\r\nDue to her generalist background and versatility, she later assumed the role of our Training Supervisor, leading all learning & development efforts for our industrial population of 2000+ employees. Additionally, she was also responsible for developing, coordinating and delivering training programs for our professional and management staff. It was as our Training & Development Supervisor that Maribel's strengths and capabilities truly flourished. Her dynamic and creative approach was a natural fit in the training department, quickly building a strong operations training team, as well as coaching and mentoring her team members into capable leaders themselves. Additionally, Maribel helped drive the plant's employee engagement program, developing & deploying improvement plans along with the implementation of the annual survey itself. The engagement results at our Philips Tijuana plant were some of the best across the entire Lighting sector - globally.\r\n\r\nAs a result of Maribel's excellent performance, she was promoted beyond the scope of the Tijuana location to take on increasing role's of responsibility as the Learning & Development Manager for Philips Mexico, and later increasing her scope to include Central America and various regions across Latin America.\r\n\r\nAny organization considering to add Maribel to their team will be rewarded with a sharp, determined, highly capable and energetic Human Resources professional that will have a positive and lasting impact on their staff and business.\r\n\n\n...

For the last 10 years, I’ve worked alongside him at the Tijuana operation, privileged to be a part of the growth, continuous improvement, and exceptional performance that has cemented Tijuana’s reputation as a global operations benchmark at Philips. And as a result, Jesus’ role has expanded to include additional manufacturing sites as well outsourced mfrg for North America.\r\nThis performance and reputation is due in large part to the direction, guidance and leadership provided by Jesus. In those 10 years, the operation has not only expanded in scope, size and product offerings – but as well in its strategic importance to Philips Lighting globally. Jesus has built a highly effective, highly capable and highly flexible organization that continues to evolve with the changing demands of the markets, customers and industry overall. And it’s now uniquely positioned for the LED transformation currently underway in the market.\r\nWhat separates Jesus from other Operations Directors is his ability to connect and motivate entire organizations – from the shopfloor and warehouse to senior staff, peers and beyond. He’s able to stay close enough to the details to contribute in all aspects, yet strategic still in guiding the organization towards a successful future. All the while, he role models his sincere commitment of continuous improvement by actively and openly seeking guidance to still improve his own skillset, even with such significant professional experience. A humble yet highly successful operations professional.\r\nHe is truly an inspiring leader that builds relationships, teams, people and the business.
