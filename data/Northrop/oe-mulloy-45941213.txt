I had the privilege of serving with him a number of times in my 38 year Naval career when we overlapped in the U.S. Navy’s Submarine Force. His executive level leadership, communication skills, drive and problem solving acumen are truly exceptional. \n\nBill stepped forward to solve problems with vigor and drive but more importantly he had “forehandedness” to see where problems may emerge and then recommend action to nip things in the bud – that is true value, that a boss and his/her team really need to keep an organization running smoothly.\n\nMaster Chief Cronin is an inspiring leader who always gets the very best from his team. I would take him on my team any day.\n\n\n... See more","profileImage":"","name":"William D.
