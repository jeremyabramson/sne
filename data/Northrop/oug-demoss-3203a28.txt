The Weapon Systems strategic business unit grew to be the largest in the entire business thanks to Keith's ability to plan, organize, and execute complex operations across multiple sites and functions to cost effectively meet warfighters' needs at the height of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Later, Keith was asked to take charge as the senior leader overseeing GDATP's medium caliber gun product lines, and he capably improved efficiencies in multiple ways to drive out costs and win key competitive awards. Keith's many talents and operational competence made him a key member of the GDATP senior leadership team, and it was a pleasure to work with him during the eight years that our we overlapped in the business.
