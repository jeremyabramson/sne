I do not write a large number of professional recommendations; however, this is an easy one that I am honored to provide.\n\nI have had the pleasure of working with Aida over the last four years while a Tech Fellow at Northrop Grumman with her supporting from LUNA. Her technical knowledge of our fiber sensing needs was key to keeping the technology alive and moving forward towards a successful transition into production. We never asked a question or had an issue that she was unable to address. Aida became a true member of our team and not just in a supplier role.\n\nHowever, technical knowledge is not enough. Aida's thoughtful and calm ways of addressing complex problems and heated schedules made working with her a pleasure.\n\nAny team should consider themselves extremely fortunate to have her as a member, and this comes with my heartfelt recommendation. I am looking forward to working with her again in the future.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nDoug Decker\nPresident, The Composites Consultants\n\n...
