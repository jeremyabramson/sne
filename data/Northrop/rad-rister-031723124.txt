The goal of the summer intern project was to develop AI algorithms and prototype a tool that automates mapping of resources against our diverse mix of program needs. The project team consisted of four interns plus a Product Owner and Scrum Master (mentor). We gave the interns freedom in how to solve the problem, and they worked under an agile construct with 2-week sprints, product deliveries, and demos. On the project, Celine was responsible for full stack development, including development of Natural Language Processing algorithms. Having spent the summer running Scrum within a Scaled Agile team, Celine gained experience with the Northrop Grumman Agile Framework. She accomplished every story that she took on during the sprints, and Celine embraced the concept of product iteration. Most importantly, Celine is a thoughtful and engaging engineer who excels in both lead and contributing roles. As her Product Owner shared, “Celine is an excellent team member who embodies a lot of the qualities that I see in my best colleagues at Northrop Grumman.” She is collaborative and demonstrates exceptionally high EQ. She asks thoughtful and thought-provoking questions, speaks up when she has good ideas and listens to her teammates when they are sharing their own. She has an excellent technical foundation in software development and a hunger for continued growth and education that will serve her well in her extremely promising career.\nSee less","profileImage":"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","name":"Celine T.","userDescription":"Associate Software Engineer at Northrop Grumman"}]},"accomplishments":[{"count":"3","title":"Courses","items":["Agile Engineering 101","Capture Leadership Academy","Leadership Cohort Program"]},{"count":"1","title":"Publication","items":["A More Flexible Robotic Wrist"]}],"courses":[{"name":"Agile Engineering 101"}],"peopleAlsoViewed":[],"volunteerExperience":[],"contact":[]}
