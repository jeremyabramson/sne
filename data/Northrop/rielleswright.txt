Allison always came to the table with innovative ideas. One of her accomplishments was the development of individualized goals for each person in the group. After each person received their plan she coached them through the processes of how to achieve their goals. One of Allison’s greatest strengths is identifying and helping individuals determine exactly what they need to do to reach their goals.\nAllison did a phenomenal job hosting workshops for parents at Kidville Montclair. One workshop was titled, “How to Be a Better You.” This 90-minute worship helped parents create personalized SMART goals. The SMART goals helped parents identify, and determine their personal goals. During the segment she made everyone feel comfortable and offered opportunities for people who just met to work together and support each other. This was remarkable. Parents left feeling motivated, encouraged and most importantly supported. In summary Allison Task would be a tremendous asset to anyone needing help in developing themselves personally or professionally.\nSee less","profileImage":"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQEAmV7WPVJcWA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0/1531311041221?e=1619654400&v=beta&t=_CsBB0XHwUoW1pqx7cFTNlUjA-kxh0JFwfMu4iG7pV0","name":"Allison Task","userDescription":"I guide people through significant transitions that improve their lives."}],"received":[{"user":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisontask/","text":"I had the pleasure with working with Allison Task in the development of our parent classes in our early childhood center.
