Jodie is a prime example of a leader that allows direct reports to grow in a trusting and holistic work environment. Although I am a newer addition to Disney, I know that leaders like Jodie are hard to find and I am grateful to have worked closely with her.\r\n\r\nWhen my Professional Internship first began with Work Life, I was unaware of the Company’s organizational structure, supporting systems, and various policies surrounding Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Discounts and Perquisites. Jodie took the time to share her knowledge with me and continues to readily assist with Discounts and Perquisites although it is no longer her project focus. I greatly admire her dedication to the organization and the continuous support she provides on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nJodie has taken an active interest in my career goals by finding opportunities for me to learn new skills that correlate with business objectives. Soon after my Internship began with Work Life, there was a need to communicate Discount and Perquisite eligibility to our newly acquired company, Marvel Comics. Knowing that I had a passion for writing and communications, Jodie instinctively asked me to arrange the various eligibility policies and processes in a welcoming letter format. The final document that I developed was distributed to the entire Marvel employee population and was my most proud achievement under Jodie’s leadership. Jodie has an innate ability to distribute work in a way that engages and inspires those she works with because she takes the time to get to know them and find where their strengths lie. \r\n\r\nAs a result of Jodie’s ongoing mentorship and guidance, I learn something new from her every day. The candor and consideration that Jodie has shown me are something that I will never forget and are a great asset to a forward thinking organization such as the Walt Disney Company.\n\n...
