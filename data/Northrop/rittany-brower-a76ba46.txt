Loyola's MBA program, I had the opportunity to engage her in discussions in human resource management and development. I was very impressed with Brittany's ability to grasp concepts and theories and quickly apply them to situations in which she was either involved or observed, as well as her ability to take in others' views and perspectives. She showed a willingness--even eagerness--to look at situations and scenarios to test her own assumptions and challenge the status quo. She demonstrated a maturity beyond her years in engaging in questions and dialogue while never criticizing others' perspective. She asked in a way that showed a thirst for knowledge and understanding, all the while formulating her opinion or approach using all available information. Brittany has an uncanny ability to balance her natural curiosity about different perspectives with forming an opinion and presenting what she believes is the correct approach. She's fact based, diplomatic, open to discussion, and communicates well at all levels of understanding and/or heirarchy. During our class discussions and exercises, she demonstrated a natural leadership ability, executive-level presentation skills, and an openness which makes her extremely approachable. At a young age, she has a portfolio of skills which often takes people years to build.
