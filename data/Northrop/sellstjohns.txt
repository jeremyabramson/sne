I like to think of myself as a collaborative problem solver who possesses the ability to influence with and without authority, coach, mentor, and develop employees at all levels.\n\nIn my “other life”, my real estate career began in Atlanta, GA where I worked as the Real Estate Administrator for the Georgia Department of Defense. I gained experience orchestrating complex deals between government agencies and civilian agencies. I took the experience I gained and launched into residential real estate where I found continued success. My wife and I have now teamed up with the phenomenal team at Anderson Realty. I primarily focus on residential property sales in and around St. John’s county, FL as I believe that is my greatest strength because I am also a resident of the area. I have had great success in facilitating difficult transactions yielding remarkable results and high accolades. I've excelled as a top performer regularly over my career.
