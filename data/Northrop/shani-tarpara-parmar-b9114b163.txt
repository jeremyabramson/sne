Pioneered, prototyped, and integrated new mode algorithms for a next-generation radar system, which led to a successful demo of the system. Co-authored technical volume for proposals. Led test development, execution, and analysis to verify various subsets of system performance requirements. Fielded systems to their operational environments and evaluated performance at live test events. Analyzed system performance onsite at live test events to identify sources of failures and implement solutions real time. Trained system users on operation and troubleshooting of failures.\nsee less","date1":"Jul 2013 – Jun 2016","date2":"3 yrs","location":"Baltimore, Maryland Area"},{"title":"Professional Development Rotational Program","description":"Completed rotations in the Systems Engineering, Business Development, and Data Processing organizations as part of the company's two-year rotation program for recent college graduates.
