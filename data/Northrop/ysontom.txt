He coordinated requirements analysis, solution design, testing, implementation, and support. He prepared and delivered project status reports, managed defects, and oversaw issue resolution. He also initiated and managed relationships with vendors, ensuring that they met schedule, budget, and quality requirements.\n\nTom led several multi-million-dollar programs in this role. The two key initiatives were the development of a common Mobility Manager Platform for the CDMA Division and the commercial delivery of a redesigned, highly integrated, custom hardware site controller. The common Mobility Manager Platform helped the division to increase sales while reducing costs and improvement times but required some significant change management leadership from Tom to overcome internal culture issues. The site controller redesign was completed in just 9 months, 3 months ahead of schedule, resulting in a \"ready to ship\" commercial product. Tom led the product documentation, training, and initial field installations. Also, through a series of hardware implementations, he helped to drive $5M in monthly cost savings.\n\nTom was a key driver of quality within the organization, creating an escaped defect analysis (EDA) that improved defect containment by 50% and was adopted division-wide. He also optimized customer review and acceptance processes for production telecommunications systems for clients with billions of dollars of revenue at risk.\nsee less","date1":"Oct 2001 – Nov 2005","date2":"4 yrs 2 mos"},{"title":"Lead Software Engineer","description":"Tom led a team of 9 software engineers in the development, delivery, and support of I/O subsystems. He and his team worked with the business to understand their functional needs, develop targeted technical specifications, and create innovative solution strategies.

Together, the designed a breakthrough solution that served as a common, reusable site controller compatible with a small form factor infrastructure. The advent of this solution helped the Global Telecom Solutions Group to increase product sales.\nsee less","date1":"Oct 1999 – Oct 2001","date2":"2 yrs 1 mo"},{"title":"Senior Software Engineer","description":"Tom was recruited as a Software Engineer and promoted to positions of increasing accountability in Motorola's Network Solutions and Land Mobile Products Groups. During this time, he led teams of up to 6 engineers in the design, development, and implementation of software products and solutions. A series of projects he led resulted in the increased reliability of the EBTS site controller and site controller management for up to 24 base radios. His team was able to add features to enhance the support and management of the packet data channels on the existing site controller. They were also able to automate failure recovery and software upgrades as well as to extend the standby controller application performance.\nsee less","date1":"May 1994 – Oct 1999","date2":"5 yrs 6 mos"}]},{"title":"Entrepreneurial Intern","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Software%20Artistry","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Software%20Artistry","companyName":"Software Artistry","location":"Indianapolis, Indiana Area","description":"Tom completed this prestigious entrepreneurial internship program.","date1":"1993","date2":"less than a year"},{"title":"Engineering Intern","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/endress-hauser-group/","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/endress-hauser-group/","companyName":"Endress+Hauser Group","location":"Indianapolis, Indiana Area","description":"Tom created and tested a prototype microwave material flow detector and completed a new circuit design.","date1":"1992","date2":"less than a year"}],"educations":[{"title":"Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology","degree":"Bachelor of Science (BS)","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/18360/?legacySchoolId=18360","fieldOfStudy":"Electrical Engineering","date1":"1990","date2":"1994","description":"Concentrations in Control Systems and Radio Communications"}],"skills":[{"title":"Embedded Systems","count":"53"},{"title":"Software Development","count":"48"},{"title":"Software Engineering","count":"42"},{"title":"Wireless","count":"41"},{"title":"Telecommunications","count":"32"},{"title":"Integration","count":"32"},{"title":"Agile Methodologies","count":"28"},{"title":"System Architecture","count":"26"},{"title":"Software Project Management","count":"23"},{"title":"Program Management","count":"21"},{"title":"Systems Engineering","count":"16"},{"title":"Vendor Management","count":"14"},{"title":"Requirements Analysis","count":"10"},{"title":"Project Management","count":"9"},{"title":"Mobile Communications","count":"6"},{"title":"Wireless Technologies","count":"6"},{"title":"Continuous Improvement","count":"5"},{"title":"Product Development","count":"5"},{"title":"Test Management","count":"4"},{"title":"SDLC","count":"4"},{"title":"Software Design","count":"4"},{"title":"International Development","count":"1"},{"title":"Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)","count":"1"},{"title":"Defense"},{"title":"Change Management"},{"title":"Project Planning"},{"title":"Agile"},{"title":"Scrum"},{"title":"Embedded Software","count":"41"},{"title":"Linux","count":"11"},{"title":"RTOS","count":"8"},{"title":"C++","count":"4"},{"title":"Perl","count":"4"},{"title":"Java","count":"2"},{"title":"Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)","count":"1"},{"title":"Engineering Management","count":"27"},{"title":"Cross-functional Team Leadership","count":"26"},{"title":"Management","count":"13"},{"title":"Leadership","count":"8"},{"title":"Team Leadership"},{"title":"Product Specification","count":"2"},{"title":"Technology Roadmapping","count":"2"}],"recommendations":{"givenCount":"2","receivedCount":"5","given":[{"user":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeqawilliams/","text":"Tom is a great engineering manager and led the development of High Availability Network Software for the iDEN system.
