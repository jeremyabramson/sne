I've had the pleasure of knowing Szac for 3 years, during which we have been peers in the School of Business at SPU as well as co-leaders of a small group on our dorm hall floor. Above all, I was impressed with Szac's ability to lead a group and cater to the needs of a variety of different people. And, of course, his ability to think critically and provide customer service. Szac would be a true asset for any positions requiring the ability to multi-task and handle customer needs in a timely manner, and comes with my heartfelt recommendation.
